//! Detect a running UFFS Access Broker.
//!
//! The broker is an elevated Windows service that vends read-only NTFS
//! volume handles to a non-elevated daemon.  [`broker_pipe_present`] lets
//! the client's daemon-spawn logic ([`crate::daemon_spawn`]) decide
//! whether a non-elevated `uffs` can start the daemon anyway (the daemon
//! then obtains handles from the broker) instead of returning
//! [`crate::error::ClientError::DaemonNeedsElevation`].
//!
//! This whole module is `#[cfg(windows)]` (declared so in `lib.rs`), so
//! it carries no per-item cfg gates.

/// Return `true` when the UFFS Access Broker named pipe exists — i.e. the
/// broker Windows service is installed and running.
///
/// Uses `WaitNamedPipeW`, which checks pipe **availability without
/// connecting**. The previous `GetFileAttributesW` probe *opened* the pipe to
/// read its attributes, which the broker saw as a real connection and logged as
/// a rejected `uffs.exe` client on **every** search (FU-6) — wasteful, and it
/// consumed a pipe instance the single-instance broker then had to recover.
/// `WaitNamedPipeW` never opens the pipe, so the broker sees nothing.
///
/// Presence semantics: an available instance → `Ok`; an existing-but-busy pipe
/// → `ERROR_SEM_TIMEOUT`; a missing pipe → `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`.  Only
/// `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` is treated as "no broker"; everything else is
/// present, so a momentarily-busy broker isn't a false negative (the daemon's
/// real handle request is the authoritative test either way).
