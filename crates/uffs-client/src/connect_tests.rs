//! Unit tests for [`crate::connect::UffsClient`] (the async client)
//! that exercise the wire-protocol path without opening a real socket.
//!
//! The tests inject in-memory tokio `AsyncRead` / `AsyncWrite` halves
//! via [`UffsClient::from_parts_for_test`], pre-populate the reader
//! with canned JSON-RPC responses, and assert that the client
//! interprets them correctly.
//!
//! These are the async siblings of the `connect_sync_tests` suite —
//! the Run 10 Part B (2026-04-19) `cached_status` short-circuit ships
//! on both clients, and both code paths deserve regression pins.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! * `deep_health_check` happy path (probe succeeds → `Ok(())`, method must be
//!   `status`, not the pre-Run-10-B `drives`).
//! * `deep_health_check` probe-error path (daemon returns a JSON-RPC error →
//!   `ConnectionFailed` with remediation guidance).
//! * `deep_health_check` populates `cached_status` so `await_ready`
//!   short-circuits without a second RPC.
//! * `deep_health_check` clears `cached_status` on probe failure so a stale
//!   `Ready` cannot lie.
//! * `await_ready` short-circuits on a cached `Ready` and falls through to
//!   polling on any other cached state.
