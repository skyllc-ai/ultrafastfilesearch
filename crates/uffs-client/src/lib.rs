//! Thin client library for the UFFS daemon.
//!
//! All surfaces (CLI, TUI, GUI, MCP) use this crate to communicate with
//! the daemon. It handles auto-start, connection, keepalive, and reconnect.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let client = UffsClient::connect().await?;
//! let results = client.search("*.rs").await?;
//! let drives = client.drives().await?;
//! ```
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! Documented per the workspace dependency policy
//! (`docs/architecture/code-quality/dependency_policy.md`, playbook §988).
//!
//! | Feature | Default? | Enables | Adds deps | API impact | Semver |
//! |---|:---:|---|---|---|---|
//! | `async` | yes | The async [`connect::UffsClient`] (tokio reactor) used by `uffs-daemon`'s embedded client + `uffs-mcp`'s bridge | `dep:tokio` (with the `net` feature) | **Additive**: enabling adds [`connect`], `connect_keepalive`, `connect_logging`, `connect_platform`, and the async test surface.  All sync items ([`connect_sync::UffsClientSync`], [`protocol`], [`schema`]) compile identically with the feature off. | Removing an item behind `async` is breaking; adding one is not. |
//!
//! ## Why `async` is default-on
//!
//! `uffs-daemon` and `uffs-mcp` both consume `uffs-client` with default
//! features so the async [`connect::UffsClient`] is available without
//! an explicit feature opt-in.  `uffs-cli` overrides with
//! `default-features = false` (see `crates/uffs-cli/Cargo.toml`) to
//! drop tokio + `ws2_32.dll` from the sync-CLI binary — the canonical
//! "consumer chooses to shrink the surface" pattern.
//!
//! ## API hygiene policy (Phase 3b §3.4 / §3.6 / §3.7)
//!
//! - **`protocol::*` wire DTOs / wire enums** — `pub` fields **are** the
//!   contract (`serde` JSON keys 1:1; §3.4).  Kept exhaustive (§3.6): monorepo
//!   deploys daemon + client together (no skew scenario), hundreds of
//!   struct-literal construction sites, and the wire enums
//!   (`SearchPredicateOp`, `SearchPayload`, `DaemonStatus`, …) are dispatch
//!   enums where exhaustive `match` is the compile-time safety net.  Revisit
//!   when this crate publishes externally.
//! - **`schema::*` field-metadata DTOs / enums** — same field-discipline
//!   reasoning as `protocol`; closed type-code enums by definition.
//! - **`UffsClient` / `UffsClientSync`** — fields private, smart constructors
//!   protect reader/writer pairing and `next_id` monotonicity invariants; sync
//!   sibling adds the Windows `deadline_guard` watchdog-already-spawned
//!   invariant.  See the focused decision record on `connect::UffsClient`.
//! - **`ClientError`** — `#[non_exhaustive]` applied (the lone API attribute
//!   change in Phase 3b); safe under both external usage patterns in
//!   `uffs-cli`.
//! - **§3.7** N/A — no `pub trait` declarations in this crate.
//!
//! # Environment
//!
//! Env vars read by this crate (registry:
//! `docs/architecture/code-quality/build_codegen_policy.md` §5, playbook
//! §1049-1056):
//!
//! | Env var | Type | Default | Notes |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` | `string` | (set by Cargo) | Read via `env!()` for `ResponseStatus::version`.  CARGO semver class. |
//! | `UFFS_CLIENT_SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK` | `bool` | `false` | Skips post-connect health probe in [`daemon_ctl`].  Used by `just ship` cross-check.  INTERNAL semver class. |
//! | `UFFS_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `int` (seconds) | `5` | Sync connect timeout override in `connect_sync_platform`.  INTERNAL semver class. |
//! | `UFFS_ELEVATE` | `string` (`auto` / `never` / `always` / `prefer`) | `auto` | Elevation policy for daemon spawn; read in `daemon_spawn::resolve_elevation_policy` (private module).  INTERNAL semver class. |
//! | `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | `path` | (XDG: `/run/user/$UID`) | Linux daemon-socket location in [`daemon_ctl`].  STANDARD semver class. |

// On docs.rs only: enable the `doc_cfg` rustdoc feature so cfg-gated items
// (`#[cfg(feature = "async")]`, `#[cfg(windows)]`, etc.) render with their
// cfg badge.  Gated behind `cfg(docsrs)` so local `cargo doc` never
// exercises the nightly-only feature.  Post-Rust-1.92 the `doc_auto_cfg`
// feature was merged into `doc_cfg` (rust-lang/rust#138907).
