//!
//! The tests inject in-memory reader/writer halves via

//! with canned JSON-RPC responses, and assert that the client
//! interprets them correctly.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! * `deep_health_check` happy path (probe succeeds → `Ok(())`).
//! * `deep_health_check` probe-error path (daemon returns a JSON-RPC error →
//!   `ConnectionFailed` with remediation guidance).
//! * `deep_health_check` transport-error path (reader closed before any bytes
//!   arrive → `ConnectionFailed`).
//! * `deep_health_check` populates the [`UffsClientSync`] status cache so
//!   [`UffsClientSync::await_ready`] can short-circuit without a second RPC.
//! * `await_ready` short-circuits on a cached `Ready` and falls through to
//!   polling on any other cached state (Run 10 Part B regression pins).

//
// The 2026-04-19 patch consolidated the connect-time health probe (what
// used to be a `drives` RPC) and the pre-search readiness poll (a
// `status` RPC) into a single `status` round-trip.  `deep_health_check`
// now caches the returned `DaemonStatus`; `await_ready` consults the
// cache first and skips its own RPC when the daemon is already Ready.
// The tests below pin both directions of that behaviour:
//
//   1. `deep_health_check_caches_ready_status_for_short_circuit` — a successful
//      probe must populate `cached_status`.
//   2. `deep_health_check_clears_cache_on_probe_error` — a failed probe must
//      clear the cache (so a stale `Ready` can never cause `await_ready` to
//      short-circuit on a lie).
//   3. `await_ready_short_circuits_when_cached_status_is_ready` — no RPC on the
//      wire when the cache is `Ready`.
//   4. `await_ready_polls_when_cached_status_is_loading` — cache != Ready must
//      fall back to the original polling path.

/// Regression pin — 2026-04-19: a successful `deep_health_check`
/// probe caches the returned `DaemonStatus::Ready` so the next
/// `await_ready` call on the same client can short-circuit without
/// issuing any RPC.  Pre-fix the cache did not exist and every CLI
/// invocation paid for a redundant `status` round-trip (~5–10 ms on
/// Windows named pipes).

/// (the probe itself).  A second RPC would mean the cache was not
/// consulted.
