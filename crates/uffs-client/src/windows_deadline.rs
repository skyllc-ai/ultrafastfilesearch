//! Windows per-RPC deadline guard for the synchronous IPC client.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! On Unix, the sync client calls `UnixStream::set_read_timeout` and
//! `set_write_timeout` — the kernel then enforces a per-operation
//! deadline for free.  Named pipes opened via `std::fs::OpenOptions`
//! on Windows expose no equivalent: the pipe is in blocking mode, and
//! `ReadFile` / `WriteFile` will wait forever if the daemon hangs.
//!
//! This module closes that gap with **Option 2** of the deadline
//! design: a long-lived background watchdog thread per client that
//! cancels synchronous I/O on the owning thread when a deadline
//! passes.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! * The guard stores a stable, duplicated handle to the thread that owns the
//!   [`crate::connect_sync::UffsClientSync`] — this handle is valid for the
//!   lifetime of the guard even after the thread exits.
//! * An [`AtomicU64`] carries the absolute `GetTickCount64` tick at which the
//!   current RPC should be aborted.  `0` means "no RPC in flight", i.e.
//!   disarmed.
//! * The watchdog thread wakes every [`WATCHDOG_POLL_MS`] ms, checks the
//!   atomic, and calls `CancelSynchronousIo` on the target thread when the
//!   deadline has passed.  It consumes the deadline (via `compare_exchange`) so
//!   each arm fires at most once.
//! * `CancelSynchronousIo` causes the blocked `ReadFile` / `WriteFile` on the
//!   target thread to return `ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED` (`0x4D3`), which bubbles
//!   up through `std::io::Read` / `Write` as a regular I/O error — the caller's
//!   existing `ClientError::Io` branch then reports it naturally.
//!
//! # Thread-affinity caveat
//!
//! The target thread is captured at construction time.  If the owner
//! later sends the `UffsClientSync` to a different thread and issues
//! an RPC from there, the watchdog will cancel I/O on the **original**
//! thread — effectively a no-op.  This is acceptable for the sync
//! client because it is used from a single short-lived thread per
//! CLI invocation, but documented here so a future refactor doesn't
//! silently regress robustness.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! * Per guard (per `UffsClientSync` lifetime): one watchdog thread, ~20
//!   wake-ups / s, negligible CPU.
//! * Per RPC (arm + disarm): two atomic stores, nanoseconds.
//! * Worst-case deadline overshoot: [`WATCHDOG_POLL_MS`] ms.
//! * Drop latency: < 1 ms.  The watchdog blocks on an
//!   [`mpsc::Receiver::recv_timeout`] pairing the 50 ms poll with an instant
//!   shutdown wake, so [`Drop`] no longer stalls waiting for the next poll
//!   cycle.  Before this fix the CLI hot path was paying ~48 ms median on every
//!   invocation (Run 11 bisect — 60 % of the entire wall-clock).
