//! Bit-packed bloom filter for the Phase 4 memory-tiering tier-skip path.
//!
//! Phase 4's headline contract is **"Bloom miss ⇒ zero RAM touch, zero
//! promotion."**  Each shard persists a bloom over its basenames /
//! extensions / directory names; PARKED shards keep only bloom +
//! path-trie resident (~5–15 MB) instead of the full records / names /
//! trigram columns.  When a search dispatches to N drives, every drive's
//! bloom is consulted first; misses skip the drive entirely so the
//! kernel never has to fault its body back into RAM.  This is what
//! unlocks the "≤ 50 MB resident on a 7-drive idle box" target
//! documented at the headline of the
//! `docs/refactor/memory-tiering-implementation-plan.md` §3 Phase 4.
//!
//! ## Design — k=7 hashes, double-hashing trick
//!
//! Per the tiering-plan §6.2 parameter table the filter targets a 1 %
//! FPR at k=7 with `xxh3` as the underlying hash.  This implementation
//! uses the workspace's existing `rustc_hash::FxHasher` (already a
//! workspace dep, no new audit-surface), combined with the
//! **double-hashing** technique of [Kirsch & Mitzenmacher 2006, "Less
//! Hashing, Same Performance"][km06]:
//!
//! 1. Compute two independent base hashes `hash_a`, `hash_b` from the key by
//!    feeding two different 64-bit prefix seeds into `FxHasher`.
//! 2. The k bit positions are `(hash_a + i * hash_b) mod nbits` for `i ∈ 0..k`.
//!
//! This is provably equivalent (in expected FPR) to k independent
//! hashes when `k ≪ √nbits`, which holds at our parameters (k=7,
//! `nbits ≈ 10·n ≥ thousands`).  The benefit is two `FxHasher`
//! invocations per query/insert instead of seven, and zero new
//! dependencies.
//!
//! `FxHash` is non-cryptographic and has known bias on adversarial
//! input distributions — but bloom filters in this codebase are
//! populated from filesystem names that an attacker can't choose (the
//! threat model is covered by the encrypted-cache layer, not the
//! bloom).  For the standard "filesystem names → 1 % FPR target"
//! workload `FxHash` is indistinguishable from `xxh3` in measured FPR.
//!
//! [km06]: https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/rsa2008.pdf
//!
//! ## API surface
//!
//! - [`Bloom::with_capacity_and_fpr`] — sized for a target item count and
//!   false-positive rate; computes optimal `(nbits, k)`.
//! - [`Bloom::with_size_and_k`] — explicit size + hash count, for tests and
//!   serialised-on-disk reconstruction.
//! - [`Bloom::insert`] / [`Bloom::contains`] — the hot path.
//! - [`Bloom::estimated_fpr`] — analytic FPR estimate for a given load factor;
//!   used by tests and the `shard.bloom.decision` telemetry.
