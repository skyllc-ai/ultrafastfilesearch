//! Extracted from `backend.rs` to keep that file under the 800-LOC file-size
//! policy. `DisplayRow` is re-exported from `backend` (`pub use`) so the
//! single-import convention downstream crates rely on
//! (`uffs_core::search::backend::DisplayRow`) is preserved.

/// A single displayable search result row.
///
/// The filename is **not** stored separately — it is derived from the `path`
/// field using `name_start` (byte offset where the filename begins within
/// `path`).  This avoids one heap allocation per result row.
///
/// `Default` is implemented manually below: [`uffs_mft::platform::DriveLetter`]
/// has no `Default` impl (it's a validated `A..=Z` newtype with no canonical
/// zero), but the `sort_rows_with_fold` hot path uses
/// [`core::mem::take`] to move rows out of a `&mut [DisplayRow]` slice
/// as part of a Schwartzian decorate/sort/undecorate transform.  The
/// take leaves a transient placeholder in the slice that's
/// immediately overwritten by the put-back step, so any consistent
