//! Per-shard USN journal refresh path (Phase 7 activation, Phase 8
//! surgical-patch).
//!
//! Two entry points feed the per-shard journal loop's
//! [`crate::cache::journal_sink::RegistryPatchSink`] applier task:
//!
//! * [`IndexManager::handle_journal_save`] (Phase 8) — clones the warm
//!   `DriveCompactIndex` body, applies the buffered
//!   [`uffs_mft::usn::FileChange`] batch via
//!   [`crate::cache::shard::ShardEntry::apply_usn_patch_to_body`], swaps the
//!   new Arc into the registry, and persists via
//!   [`uffs_core::compact_cache::save_compact_cache_background`]. Fast path:
//!   ~600 ms patch + ~5 s background save on a 7M-record drive, vs ~7 s for the
//!   full reload.
//!
//! * [`IndexManager::handle_journal_refresh`] (Phase 7) — full per-shard body
//!   refresh via [`uffs_core::compact_loader::load_drive_with_usn_refresh`]
//!   (MFT read + USN replay + compact rebuild).  Heavy (~2-7 s per drive) but
//!   correct against journal-wrap events where the buffered batch is stale
//!   relative to the new cursor.
//!
//! The split lets save triggers (events-exceeded / age-elapsed) take
//! the cheap surgical path while wrap triggers fall back to the full
//! reload — exactly the cadence the Phase-7 activation introduced,
//! now with a fast save path.
//!
//! ## Mac/Linux behaviour
//!
//! The underlying [`uffs_core::compact_loader::load_drive_with_usn_refresh`]
//! errors out by design on non-Windows targets (USN journals are
//! NTFS-only).  This method preserves that contract: the err arm
//! warn-logs the per-drive failure and returns `false` so the caller
//! can record the no-op without aborting the loop.  The surgical
//! [`IndexManager::handle_journal_save`] path is platform-agnostic
//! (it operates over the in-memory body + a `Vec<FileChange>` DTO)
//! and is exercised on Mac via synthesised `FileChange` inputs in
//! the per-method unit tests.  In production the Mac/Linux journal
//! loop wires [`MacStubJournalSource`] (always empty) so the
//! threshold-driven save trigger never fires anyway — the err arm
//! is defensive, not a hot path.
//!
