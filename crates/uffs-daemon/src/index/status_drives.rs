//! Phase 8-E — operator-facing per-drive tier + telemetry table.
//!
//! Sibling to [`super::drives`] (the legacy `drives` RPC, which
//! returns a slimmer `DriveInfo` row used by the bare `status` CLI).
//! `status_drives` widens the row to include pin state, query rate,
//! resident-bytes, and promotion counters so operators can decide
//! whether to `hibernate` / `preload` / `forget` a drive without
//! cross-referencing tracing logs.
//!
//! Three sources contribute to each row:
//!
//! * [`crate::cache::shard::ShardEntry`] — tier (`shard.state()`), in-memory
//!   body for the `resident_bytes` calculation, pin expiry
//!   (`pin_until_ms_value`).
//! * [`crate::cache::shard::DriveStats`] — query counters (`queries_total`),
//!   EMA-decayed query rate (`decay_ema_qpm`), `last_query_at_ms`.
//! * [`crate::cache::shard::ShardEntry::parked_body`] — bloom + trie
//!   `size_bytes()` for `Parked` shards (which have no `body` but still hold
//!   non-trivial RAM).
//!
//! The wire response is sorted by drive letter (case-insensitive
//! ascending) so the CLI table is stable across daemon
//! reconfigurations even when load order changes.
