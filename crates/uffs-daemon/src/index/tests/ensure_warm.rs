//! Covers:
//!
//! * Phase 3 Commit C — fast path (no Parked/Cold), filter skipping,
//!   `BodyLoader` injection (success / missing / panicking).
//! * Phase 5 (#93) — parallel re-promote contract via `SlowBodyLoader` (peak
//!   in-flight ≥ 2, wall ≈ delay not N×delay).
//! * Phase 4 task 4.11 promote-side bloom pre-check (miss case keeps Parked,
//!   hit case promotes).
//! * PR-e — single-flight dedup contract via `CountingBodyLoader` (N=10
//!   concurrent `ensure_warm` callers ⇒ exactly 1 `BodyLoader::load` call; slot
//!   clears after the cleanup task drains so re-promote loads fresh; failures
//!   propagate uniformly to all waiters).
//!
//! `FixedBodyLoader` is shared with `super::lifecycle_hooks` and
//! [`super::idle_demote`] and lives in `super` (`mod.rs`).  The
//! other loader fakes (`MissingBodyLoader`, `PanickingBodyLoader`,
//! `SlowBodyLoader`, `CountingBodyLoader`) and the
//! `wait_for_in_flight_clear` PR-e polling helper live in the
