//! Search-dispatch helpers for [`IndexManager`].
//!
//! Two pre-search hooks plus the single-flight promote machinery
//! they share live here:
//!
//! * [`Self::record_search_dispatch`] — stamp `last_query_at_ms` on every
//!   Warm/Hot shard so the demote controller sees a fresh idle clock.  Phase 3
//!   Commit C wired this; Phase 6 reads the same timestamp via
//!   `DriveStats::decay_ema_qpm` for the adaptive-TTL formulas.
//! * [`Self::ensure_warm_for_dispatch`] — promote any Parked/Cold shards the
//!   search will touch, before [`Self::snapshot`] reads the active subset.
//!   Three-phase detect → load → swap orchestration with the bloom pre-check
//!   (Phase 4 Commit F) and the per-letter single-flight dedup (PR-e).
//!
//! The single-flight machinery — [`Self::load_or_join_in_flight`],
//! [`Self::install_or_join_in_flight_slot`],
//! [`Self::build_load_future`], and the
//! [`Self::bloom_pre_check_should_promote`] decision helper —
//! lives in this module too because callers and helpers form a
//! single cohesive cluster: the dedup-map slot manager spawns
//! the body-load future, the body-load future drives the
//! `BodyLoader`/`Prefetch` lifecycle hooks, and the bloom
//! pre-check feeds the `ensure_warm_for_dispatch` filter.
//! Splitting them apart would force every entry point to import
//! every other; keeping them grouped keeps the call graph
//! readable.
