//! Phase 3 of the memory-tiering work
//! (`docs/refactor/memory-tiering-implementation-plan.md`).
//!
//! [`IndexManager::ensure_warm_for_dispatch`] needs to materialise a
//! `DriveCompactIndex` for any `Parked` / `Cold` shard the search
//! hot path touches.  The production source is the encrypted compact
//! cache on disk
//! (`<cache_dir>/<letter>_compact.uffs`); tests inject deterministic
//! fakes (fixed body, missing body, panicking loader) without
//! touching the platform cache directory.
//!
//! Both flavours implement [`BodyLoader`].  The trait is **sync** —
//! the caller in `IndexManager` wraps every call in
//! `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` since the production loader does
//! file I/O + decryption.  Test fakes are cheap and could be sync,
//! but the same `spawn_blocking` wrapper applies uniformly to keep
//! the call site simple.

/// production [`DiskBodyLoader`] for normal daemon operation, or
/// with a test fake for the Commit-E integration tests.
///
/// The single method is **synchronous** — the demote / promote
/// orchestrator wraps every call in
/// `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, so implementations can do file
/// I/O, decryption, allocation, or whatever they need without
/// blocking the async runtime.  Async work inside the loader is
/// not supported and would deadlock the spawn-blocking thread
/// pool.
///
/// Returning `None` is a graceful failure: the orchestrator emits
/// a `target: "shard.transition"` warning and leaves the shard in
/// its current tier.  A panic is also recovered by the
/// `JoinError` arm in the orchestrator and emits an error-level
/// `shard.transition` event; the shard stays put.

/// `ttl_seconds = u64::MAX` skips the freshness check — the
