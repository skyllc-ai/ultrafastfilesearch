//! Two independent counters govern when the loop drains its pending
//! change buffer, deliberately decoupled so search freshness and disk
//! persistence run on their own clocks:
//!
//! * [`SaveTrigger`] — the rare, expensive **disk save** (default 50k events /
//!   5 min).  Crossing either threshold patches the body AND persists the
//!   compact cache + cursor.
//! * [`ApplyTrigger`] — the frequent, disk-free **in-memory apply** (Phase 5
//!   debounce 250 ms / max-wait 2 s).  A settled burst — or the max-wait cap
//!   under sustained churn — patches the body so a freshly created / renamed /
//!   deleted file becomes searchable, without touching disk.
//!
//! A save subsumes an apply (it drains + applies the same buffer), so
//! the loop fires at most one of the two per tick; see
//! [`super::process_tick`].  Extracted from `journal_loop.rs` to keep
//! that file under the workspace file-size policy while keeping the two
//! cadence machines (and the threshold constants they default from)
//! together as one auditable unit.
