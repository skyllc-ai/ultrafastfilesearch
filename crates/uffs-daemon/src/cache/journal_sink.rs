//! Production [`PatchSink`] for the per-shard journal loop (Phase 7
//! activation A3, Phase 8 surgical-patch B3).
//!
//! ## Architecture — buffered applier-task pattern
//!
//! [`RegistryPatchSink::accept`] / [`RegistryPatchSink::trigger_save`] /
//! [`RegistryPatchSink::journal_wrapped`] are **synchronous** callbacks
//! invoked from the journal loop's `process_tick` (which itself runs
//! in async context via [`crate::cache::journal_loop::JournalLoop::run`]).
//! The downstream work (registry write-lock acquisition, body patching,
//! background save) is `async` and uses [`tokio::sync::RwLock`].
//! Calling `Handle::block_on` from the sync callback would re-enter the
//! runtime and deadlock.
//!
//! Phase 7 fix: each callback **enqueues** an [`ApplyMsg`] onto an
//! [`tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender`] (sync, non-blocking) and
//! returns immediately.  A single async **applier task** owns the
//! receiver and processes messages serially.
//!
//! Phase 8 B3 extension: per-letter
//! [`std::sync::Mutex<HashMap<uffs_mft::platform::DriveLetter,
//! Vec<FileChange>>>`] **pending buffer** owned by the sink.  `accept` appends
//! to the buffer synchronously (no mpsc traffic).  `trigger_save` drains the
//! buffer for that letter and ships the drained `Vec<FileChange>` into
//! [`ApplyMsg::Save`] so the applier can run a *surgical*
//! [`crate::cache::ShardEntry::apply_usn_patch_to_body`] instead of a
//! full [`uffs_core::compact_loader::load_drive_with_usn_refresh`].
//! `journal_wrapped` discards the buffer (a wrap means the journal
//! head reset, so any pending events are stale relative to the new
//! cursor) and falls back to the Phase-7 full-reload path.
//!
//! ## Apply / save cadence split (search-freshness)
//!
//! Draining the buffer only on the save tick (50k events / 5 min) left
//! freshly created / renamed / deleted files invisible to search for
//! up to 5 minutes.  `trigger_apply` decouples the two cadences: the
//! loop fires it on the apply interval (default ~30 s) to drain the buffer
//! into [`ApplyMsg::Apply`], which patches + swaps the in-memory body
//! (search goes near-live) but **skips** the compact-cache disk write
//! and the cursor persist.  `trigger_save` keeps doing the full
//! patch-plus-persist on its rare cadence, so a save tick subsumes an
//! apply.  The loop never fires both on the same poll; whichever fires
//! drains the buffer.  Because only a real body save advances the
//! on-disk cursor, a cold start re-replays the apply-only deltas from
//! the last saved cursor — idempotent against the freshly loaded body.
//!
//! Properties of the buffered design:
//!
//! 1. Preserves FIFO ordering (per-letter and across letters).
//! 2. Keeps the loop's hot path zero-cost — accept is `Vec::extend_from_slice`
//!    on a per-letter `Vec<FileChange>` under a short-held mutex.
//! 3. Save-tick latency is independent of accept-tick volume — the journal loop
//!    never blocks on the patch / swap / persist sequence.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! * Construction is via [`RegistryPatchSink::spawn_with_applier`] which
//!   returns `(Arc<Self>, JoinHandle<()>)`.  The caller (
//!   `lib.rs::spawn_journal_loops_for_warm_shards`, commit A4) keeps the
//!   `JoinHandle` and aborts it during graceful shutdown.
//!
//! * The applier holds [`alloc::sync::Weak<IndexManager>`] so the sink +
//!   applier pair never extends the daemon's lifetime past shutdown.  When all
//!   `Arc<IndexManager>` instances drop, the `Weak::upgrade` arm returns `None`
//!   and the applier exits cleanly.
//!
//! * Dropping all sinks (sink Arc count → 0) closes the `mpsc` sender.  The
//!   applier's `recv().await` then returns `None` and the task exits — same
//!   shutdown shape as the `Weak` path.
