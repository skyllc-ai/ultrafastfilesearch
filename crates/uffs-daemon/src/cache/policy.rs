//! Tier-transition policy for the demote/promote controller.
//!
//! Phase 3 (the static fallback) and Phase 6 (the adaptive layer) of
//! the memory-tiering work
//! (`docs/refactor/memory-tiering-implementation-plan.md`).
//!
//! ## Static defaults (Phase 3)
//!
//! Without a `daemon.toml` and without env-var overrides, every
//! shard demotes through the same fixed ladder:
//!
//! * **Hot → Warm** at [`HOT_TO_WARM_IDLE_SECS`] (1 min idle, default).
//! * **Warm → Parked** at [`WARM_TO_PARKED_IDLE_SECS`] (5 min idle, default).
//! * **Parked → Cold** at [`PARKED_TO_COLD_IDLE_SECS`] (24 h idle, default).
//!
//! These defaults give a fast Hot → Parked test cycle (~6 min) so
//! the Phase 4 re-promote path is exercisable during normal dev
//! iteration without dragging in `UFFS_*_IDLE_SECS` env-var
//! overrides on every launch.  Production users who want longer
//! retention windows can still set the overrides; the env-var
//! pathway is unchanged.
//!
//! Each default is overridable at daemon startup via env var.
//! The override is read once and cached; restart the daemon to
//! pick up a change.
//!
//! ```text
//! UFFS_HOT_TO_WARM_IDLE_SECS=60      \
//! UFFS_WARM_TO_PARKED_IDLE_SECS=360  \
//! UFFS_PARKED_TO_COLD_IDLE_SECS=900  \
//!     uffs --daemon start --drive C,D,E,F,G,M,S
//! ```
//!
//! ## Adaptive layer (Phase 6)
//!
//! The Phase 6 [`hot_ttl`] / [`warm_ttl`] / [`parked_ttl`] functions
//! return a per-shard `Duration` whose floor is the configured
//! `*_ttl_base_secs` and whose bonus scales with the shard's
//! query-rate EMA (`queries / minute`, half-life 60 s on the
//! `DriveStats` side; converted from queries/sec at the call site
//! by multiplying by 60).  The plan §5.2 formulas:
//!
//! * `hot_ttl   = (base + 60·log2(rate)).clamp(base, cap)` — a hot shard with
//!   sustained traffic stays hot longer, capped at 1 hr.
//! * `warm_ttl  = (base + 600·log2(rate)).clamp(base, cap)` — a warm shard with
//!   steady access keeps its body resident longer.
//! * `parked_ttl` — no rate dependence; the parked → cold edge is a wall-clock
//!   TTL because a shard that's been idle 24 h is idle regardless of whether it
//!   once had a high query rate.
//!
//! `log2(rate)` uses `max(0.0)` so a rate < 1 q/min collapses the
//! bonus to zero (floor ≡ base).  The `cap` ceiling protects
//! against pathological rates and is reached only at astronomically
//! high inputs (`rate ≈ 2^55` for the hot tier with 5-min base /
//! 1-hr cap).  See the unit tests in this module for the canonical
//! reference points.
//!
//! ## Decision function
//!
//! [`next_state_for_idle_with_thresholds`] is the single decision
//! function consumed by
//! `crate::cache::registry::ShardRegistry::demote_idle_shards`; it
//! takes the demote-edge thresholds as an explicit
//! [`TierThresholds`] struct so the demote controller can size them
//! per-drive from the live rate EMA + the user's `daemon.toml`
//! `[tiers]` section.  Returns `None` when the shard is not yet
//! idle past its current tier's TTL or when the tier is already at
//! the bottom.
