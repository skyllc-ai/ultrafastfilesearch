//! Process-level memory-pressure signal pipeline (Phase 5 task 5.3).
//!
//! Cooperates with Windows's
//! [`MEMORY_RESOURCE_NOTIFICATION_TYPE`][win32-mem]:
//! `LowMemoryResourceNotification` fires when free RAM drops below the
//! kernel's threshold; `HighMemoryResourceNotification` fires when it
//! rises back above.  The daemon's subscriber loop translates `Low`
//! into a cascade demote of LRU Warm shards
//! (see [`crate::index::IndexManager::cascade_demote_one_step`])
//! until either the registry has no Warm shards left or `High` arrives.
//!
//! On Windows, [`PlatformPressureSignal::new`] spawns a dedicated
//! kernel thread (`uffs-pressure`) that owns the two notification
//! handles plus a manual-reset shutdown event.  Its main loop calls
//! `WaitForMultipleObjects` with `INFINITE` and translates the
//! signaled handle into a `PressureLevel::Low` / `PressureLevel::High`
//! send on the inner [`watch::Sender`].  On `Drop`, the struct
//! signals the shutdown event, joins the watcher, and closes the
//! handles.  Handle-creation failure (very old or stripped Windows
//! editions, or handle exhaustion at startup) is logged at warn-level
//! and the signal degrades to "never-fires" — the daemon falls back
//! to TTL-driven demotion alone.
//!
//! Mac/Linux ship a never-fires stub — there is no portable
//! process-wide notification API on those targets and the kernel
//! handles reclaim itself; demotions are TTL-driven via
//! [`crate::index::IndexManager::demote_idle_shards`].
//!
//! ## Wire shape
//!
//! [`IndexManager`][im] holds the trait as
//! `Arc<dyn PressureSignal>`.  Production wires
//! [`PlatformPressureSignal`]; the Phase 5 unit tests inject
//! `tests::ControllablePressureSignal` so the test can `set(Low)` /
//! `set(High)` and assert the cascade behaviour deterministically
//! without any real OS pressure.
//!
//! The signal is delivered as a [`tokio::sync::watch::Receiver`]
//! returned by [`PressureSignal::subscribe`].  `watch` is the right
//! primitive here: it carries the *latest* value (so a subscriber
//! that joined late still sees the current pressure level) and
//! `changed().await` only wakes on transitions.  Multiple subscribers
//! are supported but the production daemon only needs one (in
//! `lib.rs::spawn_pressure_subscriber`).
//!
