//! `uffs-bench` binary entry point — a thin shim over the library.
//!
//! All behavior lives in the [`uffs_bench`] library (parsed flags in
//! [`uffs_bench::Cli`], orchestration in [`uffs_bench::run`]) so it is
//! unit-testable under the `MockHost` on any OS. This binary only wires the
//! real [`SystemHost`] to the parsed CLI and propagates any error through the
//! process [`std::process::Termination`] path (which prints the `Debug` form to
//! stderr and exits non-zero) — keeping the shim free of ad-hoc `eprintln!`.

// Suppress `unused_crate_dependencies` for deps consumed by the library crate
// (`lib.rs` and its modules) rather than this thin binary, in line with the
// workspace convention (see `uffs-daemon`/`uffs-mcp` `main.rs`).
