//! # USN Journal Integration (M5 Optimization)
//!
//! This module provides USN (Update Sequence Number) Journal integration for
//! incremental index updates. Instead of rescanning the entire MFT, we can
//! query the USN Journal for changes since the last index build.
//!
//! ## Module layout
//!
//! * This file (`usn/mod.rs`) holds the platform-agnostic types — the [`Usn`]
//!   newtype, the DTOs ([`UsnJournalInfo`] / [`UsnRecord`] / [`FileChange`]),
//!   the [`reason`] flag constants, the [`ChangeType`] taxonomy, the
//!   [`aggregate_changes`] helper, and the non-Windows error stubs.
//! * `usn/windows.rs` (Windows only) contains the `#[repr(C)]` Win32 ABI mirror
//!   structs and the `FSCTL_QUERY_USN_JOURNAL` / `FSCTL_READ_USN_JOURNAL` /
//!   targeted-FRS-read FFI helpers.  Its public functions are re-exported by
//!   this module under `#[cfg(windows)]`.
//!
//! ## Windows API
//!
//! - `FSCTL_QUERY_USN_JOURNAL` - Get journal info (ID, first/next USN)
//! - `FSCTL_READ_USN_JOURNAL` - Read changes since a given USN
//!
//! ## Change Types
//!
//! - `USN_REASON_FILE_CREATE` - New file created
//! - `USN_REASON_FILE_DELETE` - File deleted
//! - `USN_REASON_RENAME_NEW_NAME` - File renamed
//! - `USN_REASON_DATA_EXTEND/TRUNCATE` - File size changed
//! - `USN_REASON_BASIC_INFO_CHANGE` - Timestamps changed

/// Monotonically-increasing per-volume Update Sequence Number from the

///   is now expressed against the typed value rather than ad-hoc `i64`
///   arithmetic on bare fields.
///
/// Not carried by the type system (kernel-issued / format-defined):
