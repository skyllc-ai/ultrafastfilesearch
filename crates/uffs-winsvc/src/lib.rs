//! Native Windows **service control** (SCM) plus the broker **named-pipe
//! readiness** probe — the single source of truth for the mechanics that
//! were previously hand-rolled with `sc.exe` across `uffs-broker`,
//! `uffs-update`, and `uffs-cli`.
//!
//! Why native, not `sc.exe`: `sc query` prints **localized** state words
//! (`RUNNING`/`STOPPED`), so text-matching them silently breaks on a
//! non-English Windows. The SCM APIs here return the **numeric**
//! `SERVICE_RUNNING` (4) etc., which are locale-proof. This crate is pure
//! *mechanism* and takes the service/pipe name as a parameter; the broker's
//! *identity* (its `SERVICE_NAME` / `PIPE_NAME`) lives in
//! `uffs-broker-protocol`.
//!
//! Cross-platform: every public function compiles everywhere. Off Windows
//! there is no SCM, so [`query`] reports [`ServiceState::NotInstalled`],
//! [`stop`] is a no-op, [`start`] errors, and [`pipe_serving`] is `true`.
