//! Minimal subset of the gate-manifest schema needed by the workflow
//! structural validator.
//!
//! # Why duplicate (a subset of) `scripts/ci/gen-hooks/src/manifest.rs`?
//!
//! `gen-hooks` and `gen-workflow` both read `scripts/ci/gates.toml`.
//! A purist refactor would extract a shared `uffs-gates-schema`
//! library crate that both binaries depend on.  We deliberately
//! deferred that for this PR for two reasons:
//!
//! 1. The cross-tool dependency graph is currently zero-coupled (gen-hooks
//!    doesn't depend on gen-workflow and vice versa); a shared crate would
//!    introduce a new internal dependency just to hold ~30 lines of struct
//!    definitions.
//! 2. Serde's default `deserialize_unknown_fields = false` means additive
//!    changes to the manifest schema (new fields in `[[gate]]`) are silently
//!    absorbed by both deserializers — the common drift mode (gen-hooks gains a
//!    field, gen-workflow stays blissfully unaware) is safe.  Removal of a
//!    field gen-workflow uses fails noisily on first parse; loud regression
//!    beats silent corruption every time.
//!
//! When this assumption breaks (e.g. both generators need a complex
//! shared validator), promote this module + the gen-hooks one into a
//! `scripts/ci/gates-schema` library.  Until then: keep it simple.
//!
//! # Schema subset
//!
//! gen-workflow only needs:
//! - `id` — gate's stable identifier
//! - `label` — human-readable string (used in error messages)
//! - `tiers` — to filter to `pr-fast`
//! - `gate_when` — the change-classification predicate, mapped to the
//!   workflow's `if:` field
//! - `consumer_names` — per-tier job-id override (e.g. `lint-ci` appears as job
//!   `clippy` in pr-fast.yml)
//!
//! Every other field (`command`, `bucket`, `notes`, etc.) is
//! ignored via `serde(default)` on the surrounding struct + serde's
//! permissive mode for unknown TOML keys.
