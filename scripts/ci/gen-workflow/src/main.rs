//! `gen-workflow` — gate-manifest workflow structural validator.
//!
//! Phase 3 deliverable from `docs/architecture/gates-manifest-plan.md`
//! (relative to the repo root).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Plan §4.2 originally specified a YAML emitter that would own the
//! per-gate job blocks in `.github/workflows/pr-fast.yml` between
//! marker comments.  Investigation during Phase 3 prep showed every
//! per-gate job in the workflow is bespoke (eleven distinct shapes
//! for ~thirteen pr-fast-tier gates: differences in runner OS,
//! timeout, `needs:` chain, rust-cache key strategy, free-disk
//! preamble, conditional cargo-vet install + run, multi-step
//! commands).  Encoding all of that in TOML so the generator can
//! emit it back is a YAML-in-TOML translation problem with no real
//! upside, AND it stakes branch protection on a hand-rolled YAML
//! emitter.
//!
//! The plan was revised in PR #142 to a `--check`-only structural
//! validator that retains every drift-protection guarantee at the
//! same risk profile as Phase 1's `gates-drift` — the tool only
//! reads files; it cannot break the workflow.
//!
//! # Properties enforced
//!
//! 1. **Job presence** — every manifest gate with `tier="pr-fast"` has a
//!    corresponding job in `pr-fast.yml` (resolved via
//!    `consumer_names["pr-fast"]` if present, else the gate id). Multiple gates
//!    may fold into one job (e.g. `rustdoc` + `doc-tests` → `docs`); the
//!    validator handles many-to-one.
//! 2. **`if:` predicate alignment** — for each pr-fast job, the job's `if:`
//!    predicate must be at least as permissive as the least-upper-bound of the
//!    `gate_when` classes of the gates folded into it.  Wider is fine
//!    (over-runs); narrower is drift (would block a gate from running on its
//!    trigger).
//! 3. **Aggregator coverage** — every gate's resolved job-id is in
//!    `required.needs:`, the `declare -A R=(...)` aggregator inside the
//!    `required` job, AND `notify-failure.needs:`.  This is the exact
//!    rename-bookkeeping failure mode that motivated the whole plan.
//! 4. **Branch-protection guard** — the `required` job's `name:` field is
//!    exactly the literal string `PR Fast CI / required`. This name is in the
//!    repo's branch-protection rule (`required_status_checks`); a refactor that
//!    renamed it would silently break merge for every subsequent PR.
//!
//! Property 5 from the plan ("naming convention") is intentionally
//! deferred — see plan §4.2 for the rationale (multiple gates fold
//! into one job, so display names like `Clippy` are not 1:1
//! derivable from manifest fields without a schema extension).
