# Claude Code PreToolUse guard: reject any Bash tool call that bypasses the
# repo's quality gates.
#
# Blocked patterns:
#   * `--no-verify`        — skips the pre-commit / pre-push hooks entirely
#   * `-c core.hooksPath=` — inline override that silently disables the
#                            tracked hooks in scripts/hooks/
#
# Why this exists: the gates (fmt, typos, file-size, clippy, deny, ...) are
# the repo's contract.  A whole branch was once committed with --no-verify
# "for fast iteration" and the accumulated drift (25 files of rustfmt rot,
# typos, file-size violations) only surfaced at merge time.  Fix the failing
# gate at its root instead of skipping it.
#
# Wired up in .claude/settings.json (PreToolUse, matcher "Bash").  Exit code
# 2 blocks the tool call and feeds stderr back to the agent.
