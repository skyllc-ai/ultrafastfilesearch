//! * [`StepTracker`]   — fine-grained set of completed / failed step ids.
//! * [`WorkflowState`] — the whole thing, persisted atomically to

//!
//! [`STEP_*`](ALL_STEPS) constants are the step-id source of truth — they
//! are embedded in the on-disk JSON, so renaming one is a
//! backwards-incompatible change to the resumable-state format.
