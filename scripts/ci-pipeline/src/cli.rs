//! `clap` command-line parser target for the UFFS CI pipeline driver.
//!
//! One `Cli` struct for every global flag the pipeline reads and one
//! `Commands` enum for the subcommand dispatch.  Both types are visible
//! to sibling modules via `pub(crate)`; keep everything else `private`
//! so the public API of the binary crate stays narrow.

// `Cli` is a `clap::Parser` derive target that deliberately mirrors
// every boolean CLI flag as a `bool` field.  Refactoring this into a
// bitflags struct or grouping-by-subcommand would break the `clap`
// derive machinery and the `--help` output.  The "too many bools" lint
// is legitimately noise for option-parsing types; scope the suppression
// to this struct only.
