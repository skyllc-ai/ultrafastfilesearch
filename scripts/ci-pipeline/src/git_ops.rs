//! `git` + `gh` CLI helpers that Phase 2 of the ship pipeline drives.
//!
//! The entry points are [`git_commit`] (create the `chore: development
//! vX.Y.Z ...` signed commit) and [`git_push`] (push the release
//! branch + open the release PR with auto-merge queued).  Each of the
//! push sub-steps (`ensure_on_release_branch`, `rebase_onto_upstream`,
//! `push_release_branch`, `find_existing_release_pr`, `open_release_pr`,
//! `enable_auto_merge`, `return_to_base_branch`) is its own small helper
//! so a failure points at a named function in the backtrace and
//! refactors stay surgical.
//!
//! The auto-commit is created on the `release/vX.Y.Z` branch (see
//! [`git_commit`] / `switch_to_release_branch`), never on `main`, so a
//! ship leaves local `main` exactly at `origin/main` — no post-merge
//! `git reset --hard` is ever needed.
//!
//! [`count_unpushed_commits`] is the Phase 6 (resumable-push-fix)
//! helper: it lets the ship pipeline detect "HEAD is ahead of
//! `origin/release/<ver>`" and re-run the cached-completed push step
//! instead of silently skipping it.

         routes that commit through branch-protection rules.  Once it \
         merges to `{base_branch}`, run `just release-tag` to cut the \
         signed `v{version}` tag, which fires `release.yml` and builds \
         the cross-platform binaries + GitHub Release v{version}.  \
