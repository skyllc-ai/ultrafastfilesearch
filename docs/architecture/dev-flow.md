**Changelog**
- 2026-04-23 — Initial doc after v0.5.71 ship post-mortem.  Surfaced three
  bugs (ship resumable push-skip, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` vs sccache drift,
  `rust-script` stale cache) and three shift-left gaps
  (`cargo vet`, doc tests, `cargo machete`) exposed by PR #43's
  four-iteration supply-chain failure loop.
- 2026-04-23 — External review pointed out structural gaps: v1 treats
  CI as one long lane, soft-skips gates that should be hard-required,
  and proposes a split-brain cache policy.  Follow-up captured in
  `dev-flow-implementation-plan.md`; §6 of this doc is retained for
  historical context but the plan doc is the authoritative roadmap.
- 2026-04-23 — Plan doc revised to **v3** after a second external
  review round.  Eleven correctness fixes to the v2 plan: `required`
  aggregator now depends on `classify`; compile/test gates use
  `code_changed = rust || dep || infra` (not just `rust`);
  pre-push reads git's stdin protocol; preview workflow gates on
  `PR Fast CI / required` being green for the same SHA; new §2.8
  Actions hardening policy.  See `dev-flow-implementation-plan.md`
  §10 for the full diff.

## 1. Purpose

This document is the **single source of truth for where each quality gate
lives and why**.  It exists because today (2026-04-22 → 23) a straightforward
patch release loop (v0.5.71) needed four ship attempts to land on origin,
and three of those four failures were preventable by moving one CI-only
gate earlier in the flow.

Who this is for:

- Any contributor modifying `.github/workflows/*.yml`,
  `scripts/hooks/*.sh`, `scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs`, or `just/*.just`.
- Future-me reading the reflog wondering "why did we move `cargo vet`
  from CI to pre-push".
- New contributors trying to understand why `git commit` is fast but
  `git push` takes 30 seconds.

---

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Shift-left — but only when the cost curve crosses

A gate's ideal tier is **the earliest tier where its runtime cost is still
acceptable for the frequency of that tier**.  Run too early and every
commit/push is a slog.  Run too late and broken code escapes to CI, where
the feedback loop is ~10× slower (fetch runner → clone → install nightly →
warm caches → run gate → report).

The decision rule:

```
if gate_runtime < tier_budget AND gate_needs_no_remote_infra:
    shift it one tier earlier
```

### 2.2 Four tiers, four budgets

| Tier | Trigger | Budget | Philosophy |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| **T0 — editor-time** | on save / on keystroke | &lt; 100 ms | rust-analyzer, clippy-on-save.  Must not block typing. |
| **T1 — pre-commit** | `git commit` | &lt; 25 s warm | Cheap, staged-file scoped.  Soft-skip optional tools. |
| **T2 — pre-push** | `git push` | &lt; 60 s warm | Workspace-wide.  Catch everything locally reproducible. |
| **T3 — CI on PR** | push to PR branch | 8–15 min | Full matrix + things that need remote infra (coverage upload, SBOM, SLSA, CodeQL). |
| **T4 — CI nightly** | `schedule:` cron | 60–90 min | Slow, probabilistic (miri, mutation testing, fuzz). |

### 2.3 Defense-in-depth, not duplicated work

Running clippy at both pre-commit AND pre-push is **intentional**:
pre-commit is the fast daily-driver path; pre-push is the backstop when a
contributor uses `git commit --no-verify`.  The file-locking behavior of
cargo's target-dir means consecutive clippy invocations reuse artifacts —
the second one costs ~1–3 s.  That's correct engineering.

### 2.4 Tooling must be soft-skippable

A first-time contributor should be able to clone, `just install-hooks`, and
work immediately without `typos`, `taplo`, `reuse`, or `cargo-vet`
installed.  Every optional gate in `_lint_fast.sh` and `_lint_pre_push.sh`
must `command -v` check and print a one-line install hint on miss.

## 3. Current State — Complete Gate Matrix

Reconstructed from `scripts/hooks/_lint_fast.sh`,
`scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
and `.github/workflows/tier-2.yml` (all as of commit `185ed8825`).

**Key**: ✅ = gate runs here; — = not in this tier; **❌ bold** = gap where
CI catches something local never runs.

### 3.3 Measured budgets (current)

- **Pre-commit** — 2 s docs-only, 15–25 s with Rust changes warm sccache.
  Stays under the "must not block flow" threshold.  (Phase 2 removed xwin
  from this tier — its 40–90 s cold cost violated the T1 budget.)
- **Pre-push** — 23–45 s warm, 60–90 s cold.  Heaviest jobs: rustdoc and
  nextest `--no-run` share the same target-dir.  File-locking serializes
  them; the non-cargo jobs (deny, typos, reuse, file-size) genuinely run
  in parallel.
- **Tier 1 CI** — 8–12 min all jobs parallel.  Heaviest: `tests` (depends
  on `test-build` artifact cache).
- **Tier 2 CI** — 60–90 min.  Heaviest: `miri` (90 min timeout) and
  `coverage` (polars compile under `llvm-cov` instrumentation).

## 4. Gap Analysis — What CI Catches That Local Doesn't

### 4.1 GAP 1 — `cargo vet check --locked` is CI-only (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-23)

**Original evidence**: PR #43 (v0.5.71) failed CI's `Tier 1 / Security`
job three times with `pastey:0.2.2 missing ["safe-to-deploy"]` and
`rustls:0.23.39 missing ["safe-to-deploy"]`.  Local pre-push never
flagged either — `cargo vet` was only invoked in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

**Original shift-left rationale**:

- Cost to run locally: **1–2 s** (no compile; walks the dep graph
  against `supply-chain/audits.toml` + `imports.lock`).
- Inputs are 100% local: `Cargo.lock`, `supply-chain/*.toml`.  No
  network, no compile, no cache.
- The tool was already in `just/dev.just`'s `update-tools` list — any
  maintainer running `just update-tools` had it.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-23 via PR #45 ("feat: shift-left dev-flow
rollout (phases 1-7)") — Phase 1 of §6 below.  `scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh:224`
now runs `cargo vet check --locked` at pre-push, dep-gated on
`Cargo.{toml,lock}` or `supply-chain/` changes so the cost is paid only
on PRs that could possibly fail it.  Formalised on 2026-05-06 via PR
#140 / PR #141 (gates manifest Phases 1–2): the gate now appears as
`[[gate]] id = "vet"` in `scripts/ci/gates.toml` and is regenerated
into the pre-push hook by `just gen-hooks`.  An adjacent
`vet-audit-discipline` gate (PR #172, 2026-05-12) enforces that every
`[[exemptions.<crate>]]` version-bump carries a matching
`[[audits.<crate>]]` delta + `Vet-Reviewed-Diff:` commit trailer.

### 4.2 GAP 2 — pre-push compiles tests but never runs them (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-23)

**Original evidence**: `scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh` ran
`cargo nextest run --workspace --all-targets --all-features --no-run`.
The `--no-run` means "link all test binaries, then exit".  CI's
`Tier 1 / Tests` job ran `cargo nextest run ... --profile ci` (without
`--no-run`), which actually executed them.

**Class of bugs this missed locally**:

- Flaky tests with a timing dependency.
- Tests that depend on environment (tmpdir perms, `/tmp` being
  writable, localhost DNS).
- Assertions that are correct at compile time but wrong at runtime
  (e.g. `assert_eq!(computed, constant)` where `constant` went stale).

**Why `--no-run` was originally correct**: Running the full suite warm
is ~2–3 min on this workspace.  That blows the 60 s pre-push budget
and destroys developer flow.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-23 via PR #45 — Phase 2 of §6 below.
Added a `pre-push-smoke` nextest profile in `.config/nextest.toml`
(test-threads = -2, retries = 0, fail-fast = true, 30 s slow-timeout)
that denylists the heavy integration suite (`validate_*`) and the
`uffs-client` shmem tests (which serialise globally via
`threads-required = num-cpus`).  Everything else — unit tests across
all remaining crates — *does* run at pre-push.  Wall-time: 10–20 s
warm on a developer laptop.

`scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh:241–242` now runs **both** the
`--no-run` test-compile *and* the `pre-push-smoke` execution:

```sh
run_seq "tests" cargo nextest run --workspace --all-targets --all-features --no-run --locked --hide-progress-bar
run_seq "smoke" cargo nextest run --workspace --profile pre-push-smoke --locked
```

The full-suite execution stays at PR-time (`pr-fast.yml::tests`) as
the authoritative gate, with the smoke profile as the inner-loop
backstop.  Long-term plan (per the nextest config docstring):
replace the package-level denylist with per-test `slow` attributes
so the filter becomes `not attr(slow)` instead of an opaque list.

### 4.3 GAP 3 — doc tests are pre-push's blind spot (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-23)

**Original evidence**: pre-push ran `cargo doc -Dwarnings` which only
checked that docs *compile*.  The `cargo test --doc` step (which runs
the `/// ```rust` blocks as actual tests) was CI-only.

**Original cost-locally**: 10–30 s warm.  Most workspace crates have
&lt;20 doctests.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-23 via PR #45 — Phase 2 of §6 below.
`scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh:240` now runs
`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo test --doc --workspace --all-features
--locked` at pre-push.  Codified into the gates manifest on
2026-05-06 via PR #141 as `[[gate]] id = "doc-tests"` in
`scripts/ci/gates.toml`; the gate is regenerated into the hook by
`just gen-hooks`.

### 4.4 GAP 4 — unused-dependency detection is weekly-only (✅ CLOSED 2026-05-12)

**Original evidence**: `cargo udeps` runs only in `tier-2.yml:166-191`.
A PR that removes the last use of a workspace dep accumulated cruft
until the next Monday's Tier 2 run.

**Resolution**: `cargo machete` (sub-second AST-based unused-dep
detector — static-analysis sibling of `cargo-udeps`, no nightly
required) promoted to a **hard gate at pre-push + pr-fast** via
`scripts/ci/gates.toml [[gate]] id = "machete"` and the
`pr-fast.yml::security` job's step list.  Added to
`just install-dev-tools` so contributors onboard with the binary
required by the gate.  See
[the §12 Decisions Log entry for 2026-05-12 `cargo-machete` in `code-quality/lint-posture.md`](code-quality/lint-posture.md#12--decisions-log)
for the full decision-log record.

`cargo-udeps` stays at Tier 2 weekly as the authoritative
compile-driven check — it catches deps used only behind `#[cfg]`
gates that machete's static grep misses.  The two are complementary,
not redundant: machete is the fast inner-loop check, udeps is the
thorough weekly sweep.

### 4.5 GAP 5 — CodeQL is intentionally CI-only (🟢 LEAVE)

CodeQL SAST is a heavyweight GitHub-hosted tool.  Running locally requires
downloading the CodeQL CLI + the Rust extractor (~400 MB).  Not worth it
— clippy (`--pedantic --nursery --cargo`) plus weekly miri covers ~80% of
what CodeQL would catch for this codebase.  This gate stays where it is.

### 4.6 GAP 6 — Transient infra failures had no recovery path (✅ CLOSED 2026-05-12)

**Original evidence**: GitHub Actions' "Set up job" phase downloads
every `uses: <action>@<sha>` tarball from `codeload.github.com`
before any of our YAML steps run.  When `codeload.github.com` rate-
limits the runner's IP (HTTP 429 / `Too Many Requests`), the runner
exhausts its 3 built-in retries (with 10 s and 12 s exponential
backoff) and then fails the entire job.  No per-step retry action
(`nick-fields/retry@v3` or similar) can help — the failure happens
*before* any step gets a chance to execute.

Observed on PR #175 (zstd retire-vestige) and PR #174 (cargo-machete)
on 2026-05-12: CodeQL's "Set up job" 429'd while downloading the
`github/codeql-action` tarball; the analyse job died.  Same
infrastructure issue could hit pr-fast.yml or tier-2.yml and would
appear as a "real" CI failure, blocking merge until a maintainer
manually clicked "Re-run failed jobs".

**Resolution**: Two-layer hardening landed in this PR:

- **Layer A** — `continue-on-error: true` on `codeql.yml::analyze`.
  Codifies the workflow's own docstring (which already said *"the
  check is NOT wired into branch protection"*) at the workflow-
  engine level.  CodeQL job failures still show as ❌ in the PR's
  check-runs panel, but the workflow conclusion is `success` so
  branch protection / auto-merge are not affected.

- **Layer B** — new `auto-rerun-transient.yml` watcher.  Triggers
  on `workflow_run` completion of the three main workflows
  (`PR Fast CI`, `🔍 CodeQL (Rust SAST)`, `🌙 UFFS Tier 2 Nightly
  CI`).  For each completed run with `run_attempt < 2` (loop
  prevention), it inspects the logs of every failed job; if any
  log matches a transient-infra regex (`429` / `ECONNRESET` /
  `EAI_AGAIN` / `runner has lost contact` / `No space left on
  device` / etc.) it calls `POST /actions/runs/<id>/rerun-failed-
  jobs` to re-execute exactly the failed jobs once.  Persistent
  failures (real compile / test errors) do not match the regex and
  stay red.

**Bounded retry**: `run_attempt < 2` enforces *exactly one*
auto-rerun per run.  If the rerun also fails with a transient
signature, the second attempt (`run_attempt = 2`) is *not*
re-retried — a human investigates.  Worst-case overhead: ~30 s per
transient failure, single-digit per week.

**Policy classification** added by this PR:

| Job kind | Branch protection | Failure visibility | Auto-rerun? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Required (pr-fast.yml `required` aggregator) | blocks merge | red ❌ until fixed | yes if transient |
| Advisory (`continue-on-error: true`) | does not block | red ❌ on job, ✅ workflow | yes if transient |
| Tier 2 weekly | does not block PRs | `ci-failure-tier-2` issue auto-opened | yes if transient |

### 4.7 GAP 7 — MSRV is declared but never verified (🟠 MEDIUM, OPEN)

**Evidence**: The workspace declares `rust-version = "1.91"` in
`Cargo.toml` and `msrv = "1.91"` in `clippy.toml`, and the
`clippy::incompatible_msrv` lint is denied via the workspace-wide
`pedantic` group.  But `rust-toolchain.toml` pins **nightly**, not
1.91 stable, and there is no `cargo +1.91 check` job in any tier.
Every dev build and every CI build runs against the pinned nightly.

**Class of bugs this misses**: `clippy::incompatible_msrv` only fires
for APIs explicitly attributed with `#[stable(since = ...)]` after
1.91.  It is known to under-cover:

- New trait impls on existing types (the trait was added pre-1.91 but
  the impl is post-1.91).
- Deref coercion / lifetime elision rule changes that affect
  borrow-check behaviour without changing API signatures.
- New `const fn` qualifications on previously non-const APIs.
- Inference / specialisation improvements that compile pre-1.91 code
  differently on a newer toolchain.

A PR can introduce code that compiles cleanly on the pinned nightly,
passes every gate in every tier, and silently fails for any
downstream consumer on the claimed MSRV.  Pre-publish this is
theoretical (no published version yet); post-R8 it becomes a
direct SemVer breach for any patch / minor release that lands such
code.

**Why this gap exists**: The R3-Q2 round of CI hardening focused on
supply-chain (vet, machete) and runtime correctness (miri, careful,
mutants).  MSRV verification was on the candidate list but was
deprioritised because no first-publish baseline existed yet to
protect.  The cost-benefit was understood but the work was deferred.

**Proposed fix** (R3-06 candidate): Add a Tier 2 weekly `msrv` job:

```yaml
msrv:
  name: Tier 2 / MSRV (1.91 stable)
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 15
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@<sha>
    - run: rustup toolchain install 1.91 --profile minimal --no-self-update
    - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@<sha>
      with: { shared-key: tier-2-msrv }
    - run: cargo +1.91 check --workspace --locked --all-features
    - run: cargo +1.91 check --workspace --locked --no-default-features
```

Runtime cost: ~5–10 min warm.  Catches the entire class of
bugs above for the cost of one weekly compile-only check.  Promote
to a hard pre-publish gate (release-time, alongside
`cargo-semver-checks`) once R8 lands the first crates.io publish.

### 4.8 GAP 8 — Fuzz harness exists but never runs (🟠 MEDIUM, OPEN)

**Evidence**: `crates/uffs-mft/fuzz/fuzz_targets/` carries two
real libfuzzer-sys harnesses:

- `fuzz_apply_fixup.rs` — fuzzes `uffs_mft::parse::apply_fixup`,
  which handles untrusted NTFS Update Sequence Array bytes and is
  security-relevant (malformed fixup data could cause buffer
  overflows in a less-safe implementation).
- `fuzz_parse_record.rs` — fuzzes `uffs_mft::parse::parse_record`,
  the entry point for raw MFT record deserialisation.

Both harnesses are real (not skeletons): they target real public APIs
that process untrusted on-disk bytes.  Both were committed during
the shift-left rollout (mtime 2026-04-24).  But:

- Zero references to `cargo fuzz run` exist in any workflow,
  pre-push hook, or justfile recipe.
- The harnesses produce no corpus, no coverage signal, and no
  artifact stream.
- `§2.2 Four tiers` explicitly lists "fuzz" as a T4 candidate.
  Mutation testing landed in PR #180 (R3-04); fuzz was not
  scheduled and was forgotten.

This is orphaned security-relevant infrastructure: code exists and
compiles, but rots silently with every change to the underlying APIs.

**Class of bugs this misses**: Bytes-in-buffer panics, integer
overflows on malformed metadata fields, slice-bounds violations on
truncated records, infinite loops on cyclical record references.
Exactly the bug classes Miri and cargo-careful *can't* catch —
those tools harden the *known* test inputs; fuzz harnesses
generate adversarial *unknown* inputs.

**Why this gap exists**: Same answer as GAP 7 — the harnesses
were built during the security hardening sprint but the recurring-
schedule work was deprioritised.  The audit trail in the harnesses
themselves (`// Run with: cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_apply_fixup`)
suggests they were intended to be run manually, then evolve into
automation.  The manual-run phase never produced a corpus seed
commit, so any new contributor opening the repo today wouldn't
know the harnesses were ever exercised.

**Proposed fix** (R3-07 candidate): Schedule a periodic fuzz job in
Tier 2 (weekly) with a time budget instead of a run-count budget:

```yaml
fuzz:
  name: Tier 2 / cargo-fuzz (uffs-mft)
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 60
  continue-on-error: true   # advisory rollout, like mutants
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@<sha>
    - run: rustup toolchain install nightly --profile minimal --no-self-update
    - uses: taiki-e/install-action@<sha>

Long-term: persist the corpus across runs (separate artifact stream,

builds on the last instead of restarting from zero coverage.
GitHub OSS-Fuzz integration is the next tier beyond that if the
project scales to that point.

## 5. Known Bugs in the Current Flow

### 5.1 BUG A — `just ship` resumable state skips `git push` after success (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-23)

**Observed**: 2026-04-22, during v0.5.71 release.

1. First `just ship -v` run: pushed HEAD (`17022992a`) to
   `release/v0.5.71` at 21:20:18.  Step 11-git-push marked `completed`
   in `build/.uffs-workflow-state.json`.
2. CI on that HEAD failed `cargo vet`.
3. Committed audit fix `185ed8825` locally at 21:29:36.
4. Re-ran `just ship -v`.  The pipeline loaded cached state, saw every
   step marked `completed`, exited in 2 s.  **Step 11 silently skipped
   even though HEAD was 1 commit ahead of `origin/release/v0.5.71`.**
5. Had to bypass with a direct
   `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 git push origin 185ed8825:refs/heads/release/v0.5.71`
   to land the audit.

**Root cause**: `execute_step_with_tracking` in
`scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs` around line 1341 checks *only* whether the step
name is in the completed-set, not whether the underlying condition still
holds (HEAD == already-pushed-ref).

**Fix pattern**:

```rust
// Step 11 entry — before checking cached state:
let unpushed = Command::new("git")
    .args(["rev-list", "--count",
           &format!("origin/{}..HEAD", release_branch)])
    .output()
    .await?;
let n: u64 = std::str::from_utf8(&unpushed.stdout)?.trim().parse()?;
if n > 0 {
    state.invalidate_step(STEP_GIT_PUSH);
}
```

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-23 via PR #45 — Phase 3 of §6 below.
Implemented as `count_unpushed_commits` in
`scripts/ci-pipeline/src/git_ops.rs:71–86`, invoked by
`scripts/ci-pipeline/src/ship.rs:346–355` immediately before the
resumable-state machinery picks up step 11.  Source comments at
both sites cite `dev-flow-implementation-plan.md § 6.3` (the
implementation-plan companion to this doc's §6.3) so the fix is
self-referencing and bisection-friendly.  Handles the first-push
edge case (`origin/<branch>` does not yet exist) as the proposed
fix specified: `git rev-list` fails, the helper folds that into
`Ok(1)`, and the push runs.

### 5.2 BUG B — `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` vs sccache drift (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-24)

**Observed**: same release, same day.  pre-push hook failed with
`sccache: incremental compilation is prohibited: Unset CARGO_INCREMENTAL
to continue.`

**Root cause**: two unrelated configs set conflicting policies:

- `.cargo/config.toml:24` — `rustc-wrapper = "sccache"` (applies globally).
- `just/shared.just:15` — `export CARGO_INCREMENTAL := "1"` (exported into
  every `just` recipe's environment).

sccache refuses to wrap rustc when `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1` because
incremental artifacts are non-cacheable (sccache source:
`src/compiler/rust.rs`).  When `just ship` spawned `git push`, the
pre-push hook inherited `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1` from the just env, and
every cargo-invoking gate (rustdoc, deny, nextest) died.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-24 via PR #52 ("fix(preview): complete
Phase 5 re-bake — windows-latest move + RC_PATH fix") — Phase 4 of
§6 below.  The drift between `shared.just` and `.cargo/config.toml`
is now eliminated at the root by pairing both settings in one place:

- `.cargo/config.toml::[build]` carries both `rustc-wrapper =
  "sccache"` *and* `incremental = false` together, with a comment
  explicitly referencing "Bug B in docs/architecture/dev-flow.md
  § 5.2" so any future contributor reading the config sees the
  history.
- `just/shared.just` line 15 region carries a `# CARGO_INCREMENTAL is
  deliberately NOT exported here` comment that points at the same
  config-owns-cache-policy invariant, again citing Bug B and the
  implementation-plan § 2.1.

Result: every cargo invocation — from `just`, from `git` hooks, from
`rust-script`, from IDE plugins — inherits both settings as one
atomic config.  The workaround in the pipeline's `global_env`
(commit `420e82387`) was kept as defence-in-depth but is no longer
the load-bearing fix.

### 5.3 BUG C — `rust-script` serves stale binary cache (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-23)

**Observed**: same release.  My ci-pipeline.rs fix appeared to have no
effect through several attempts because rust-script's binary cache under
`~/Library/Caches/rust-script/binaries/release/` had 10+ stale compiled
versions of `ci-pipeline.rs` and was picking up a pre-fix one.

**Detection**: Added a
`[ci-pipeline][sccache-fix]` diagnostic eprintln to the source.  If the
line appeared in output, the binary was fresh.  If absent, stale cache.

**Fix**: Two options documented under § 6.5.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-23 via PR #45 — Phase 5B of §6 below.
`scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs` was promoted to a real cargo binary at
`scripts/ci-pipeline/Cargo.toml` + `scripts/ci-pipeline/src/main.rs`.
The rust-script execution path is gone; `just` recipes that used to
`rust-script scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs` now invoke `cargo run -q
--release -p uffs-ci-pipeline -- <command>` (see
`just/workflow.just::workflow-resume`).  Heisenbug class eliminated:
there is no longer a per-script binary cache to go stale.  Phase 5A
(`rust-script --clear-cache` band-aid) was deliberately *not*
adopted in favour of the structural fix.

Five phases, ordered by risk × reward.  Each phase is a single atomic
commit.

### 6.1 Phase 1 — shift `cargo vet` to pre-push (Commit 1)

**Goal**: Close Gap 1.  Never again submit a PR that fails `cargo vet`.

**Files touched**: `scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh` only.

**Diff**:

```

**Test plan**:

1. `cargo vet check --locked` — confirm passes on current HEAD.
2. `just lint-pre-push` — the new `vet` gate appears in the per-job grid.
3. Introduce a deliberate failure (e.g. transient exemption removal),
   confirm pre-push aborts.

**Runtime cost**: 1–2 s.  Pre-push budget stays under 60 s warm.

**Risk**: Zero.  Soft-skip pattern matches `typos` / `reuse`.

### 6.2 Phase 2 — add doc tests to pre-push (Commit 2)

**Goal**: Close Gap 3.  Never merge a PR with broken `/// ```rust` blocks.

**Diff**:

```diff
@@ -95,6 +95,8 @@ spawn "lint-ci"      just lint-ci

```

**Test plan**: Add a deliberately-failing doctest, confirm pre-push aborts
with `doc-tests` in the failed list.

**Runtime cost**: 10–30 s warm.  Total pre-push budget moves from 45 s to
~60 s — still within the flow threshold.

**Risk**: Low.  Pre-push may need 1 tick more time.  Nextest timing under
`--no-run` + cargo-doc overlap should amortize.

### 6.3 Phase 3 — fix ship resumable push-skip bug (Commit 3)

**Goal**: Close Bug A.  `just ship` re-run after a local commit always
pushes the new HEAD.

**Files touched**: `scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs`.

**Patch target** (around line 1341, at start of step 11 execution):

```rust
// Invariant: a push step is only "complete" if origin is at HEAD.
// If the developer has committed locally since the prior push (e.g.
// to fix a CI-detected issue such as a cargo-vet audit), the cached
// state would otherwise skip the push silently.  Re-run unconditionally
// whenever HEAD is ahead of the target remote ref.
let n_unpushed = count_unpushed_commits(&release_branch).await?;
if n_unpushed > 0 {
    println!(
        "↻ {} unpushed commit(s) on HEAD — re-running step 11",
        n_unpushed.to_string().yellow()
    );
    state.invalidate_step(STEP_GIT_PUSH);
}

execute_step_with_tracking(state, STEP_GIT_PUSH, || async {
    // ... existing push logic
}).await?;
```

Plus one helper:

```rust
async fn count_unpushed_commits(remote_branch: &str) -> Result<u64> {
    let out = Command::new("git")
        .args(["rev-list", "--count",
               &format!("origin/{}..HEAD", remote_branch)])
        .output()
        .await?;
    if !out.status.success() {
        // Remote branch doesn't exist yet — push creates it.
        return Ok(1);
    }
    Ok(std::str::from_utf8(&out.stdout)?.trim().parse().unwrap_or(1))
}
```

**Test plan**: reproduce the v0.5.71 sequence.  Run ship, let it push,
then add a commit, re-run ship.  Before fix: exits in 2 s without
pushing.  After fix: re-runs step 11, push lands new HEAD.

**Risk**: Low.  The `git rev-list` check is read-only; the invalidation is
targeted to step 11 only.

### 6.4 Phase 4 — resolve `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` vs sccache drift (Commit 4)

**Goal**: Close Bug B at root.  One authority decides the local cache
policy; no more surprises when a pipeline inherits the "wrong" one.

**Options compared**:

| Option | Change | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** — flip `shared.just` to `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` | `just/shared.just:15` | sccache covers nearly everything incremental would; one source of truth; matches CI env | First cold compile slightly slower (~5–10 %) |
| **B** — remove `rustc-wrapper` from `.cargo/config.toml`, enable sccache only in `ci-pipeline.rs` | `.cargo/config.toml:24` | Keeps local `cargo build` feeling snappy with incremental | sccache benefit lost for daily `cargo build`/test; defeats its purpose |
| **C** — keep the pipeline-level pairing (status quo) | none | Zero code change | Drift remains; the sccache server env-caching bug lurks |

**Recommendation**: **Option A**.  At UFFS workspace size (polars-heavy,
~700 dependent crates resolved), sccache-warm is consistently faster than
incremental-warm because incremental only helps crates you just edited,
while sccache hits across the entire graph.  Benchmarked on this machine:

- sccache-warm, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, `cargo build --workspace`:
  ~42 s after touching one file in `uffs-core`.
- sccache-off, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`: ~68 s same scenario.

**Diff**:

 export CARGO_NET_RETRY := "3"

 export CARGO_HTTP_MULTIPLEXING := "true"
```

And simplify `scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs` (remove the now-redundant
workaround):

```diff
-        // sccache refuses to wrap rustc when CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1 ...
-        let sccache_available = !no_sccache && command_exists("sccache");
-        if sccache_available {
-            global_env.push(("RUSTC_WRAPPER".into(), "sccache".into()));
-            global_env.push(("CARGO_INCREMENTAL".into(), "0".into()));
-            if verbose { eprintln!("[ci-pipeline][sccache-fix] ..."); }
-        }

+        // just/shared.just (see docs/architecture/dev-flow.md § 6.4).

+        if sccache_available {
+            global_env.push(("RUSTC_WRAPPER".into(), "sccache".into()));
+        }
```

**Test plan**:

1. Fresh clone + `cargo build --workspace` cold — record time.
2. Touch one file + rebuild — record time.  Should match the ~42 s above.
3. `just ship -v` through to push.  Pre-push hook all green.
4. Run a direct `git push` from shell with no env overrides.  Pre-push
   hook all green (proof that the drift is gone).

**Risk**: **Medium**.  Any `just` recipe that silently assumed
incremental compilation may feel slightly different.  Rollback is a
one-line revert.

### 6.5 Phase 5 — eliminate `rust-script` stale cache (Commit 5, optional)

**Goal**: Close Bug C.  Make `ci-pipeline.rs` changes take effect on the
next `just ship` unconditionally.

**Two approaches**:

#### 6.5.A — add `rust-script --clear-cache` to `ship-fresh`

Trivial one-line addition to `just/workflow.just:79`:

```diff
 ship-fresh *ARGS:
     @printf "..."
+    @rust-script --clear-cache >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
     rust-script scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs ship --fresh {{ ARGS }}
```

Pros: zero restructuring.
Cons: blows 3.7 GB of rust-script cache on every ship-fresh — other
scripts recompile too.  Catastrophic if multiple scripts.

#### 6.5.B — promote `ci-pipeline.rs` to a real cargo binary (RECOMMENDED)

Move `scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs` → `scripts/ci-pipeline/src/main.rs`
with a dedicated `scripts/ci-pipeline/Cargo.toml`.  Add to workspace
`members` so `cargo build -p ci-pipeline` compiles it like any other
crate.

```diff
 # Cargo.toml (workspace)
 [workspace]
 members = [
     "crates/uffs-broker",
     ...
+    "scripts/ci-pipeline",
 ]
```

Then `just/workflow.just`:

```diff
 ship *ARGS:
-    rust-script scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs ship {{ ARGS }}
+    cargo run --release -p ci-pipeline -- ship {{ ARGS }}
```

Pros: standard cargo fingerprinting catches source changes; no cache
ambiguity; ci-pipeline can use workspace dependencies cleanly;
`cargo check` in IDE picks it up.
Cons: Changes the ship invocation string (muscle memory), requires one
compile during `just ship` if source changed (seconds).

**Recommendation**: 6.5.B.  Cost: ~30 min of restructuring + updating the
docstrings.  Eliminates an entire class of Heisenbugs.

## 7. Post-Refactor Budget Targets

| Tier | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| T1 pre-commit | 15–25 s | 15–25 s | none |
| T2 pre-push | 23–45 s | 35–60 s | +12–15 s (`cargo vet` + doc tests) |
| T3 Tier 1 CI | 8–12 min | 8–12 min | none |
| T4 Tier 2 CI | 60–90 min | 60–90 min | none |

Post-refactor pre-push budget is still within the "developer flow"
threshold (&lt; 60 s ideal, &lt; 90 s tolerable).  The additional work is
strictly more caught-locally bugs.

---

## 8. Non-Goals (intentionally NOT changing)

- **Not running the full test suite at pre-push.**  2–3 min is too
  long.  Keep `--no-run` plus add `--doc` (Phase 2).
- **Not shifting CodeQL left.**  Wrong layer; 400 MB download.
- **Not shifting coverage / miri / udeps left.**  Minutes-scale.
  `cargo machete` is a fast alternative for udeps's subset, deferred to
  a future Phase 6 if needed.
- **Not duplicating CI gates at pre-push out of paranoia.**  Clippy at
  both pre-commit AND pre-push is intentional defense-in-depth for
  `--no-verify` bypass; other duplication would be noise.
- **Not removing the existing exemption-based `cargo vet` entries.**
  388 exemptions is the established posture for a small-team repo;
  wholesale auditing every transitive dep is a 100+ hour project.
  Keep the current mix: real audits for new crates (per the "no
  suppression hacks" rule applied to new deps), exemptions grandfathered
  for established ecosystem crates.

---

## 9. Industry Comparison

Surveyed pre-commit / pre-push posture of public Rust repos (sourced
from each repo's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` / `Makefile.toml` /
`scripts/hooks/`):

| Repo | pre-commit | pre-push | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **tokio** | fmt + clippy + typos | none | Heavy CI; devs run `cargo test` manually. |
| **rustls** | fmt only | none | Minimal local; heavy CI. |
| **polars** | ruff + black + minimal Rust | none | Mixed Python/Rust project. |
| **clap** | fmt + clippy | none | Heavy CI matrix. |
| **bytes** | fmt | none | Tiny; CI-heavy. |
| **UFFS (current, post-W5/L1)** | clippy trio + file-size + typos + reuse + taplo | clippy trio + rustdoc + doctests + deny + test-compile + smoke + **xwin clippy (`lint-ci-windows`)** + cargo-vet (when dep-changed) + commit-subjects + file-size + typos + reuse | Deeper local gates than any above; pre-push now strict-lints Windows-gated code via cargo-xwin clippy. |
| **UFFS (initial baseline, 2025)** | clippy trio + xwin + file-size + typos + reuse + taplo | clippy trio + rustdoc + deny + test-compile + xwin + file-size + typos + reuse | Pre-Phase-2 baseline kept here for historical reference — xwin lived at pre-commit and was a compile-only check. |

**Takeaway**: UFFS is already ahead of typical Rust OSS posture on local
coverage.  The shift-left work here is about closing two specific holes,
not adopting a new philosophy.

## 10. Execution Plan (commits, ranked)

| # | Title | Phase | Effort | Risk | ROI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `shift-left(pre-push): cargo vet check --locked` | § 6.1 | 5 min | zero | **highest** — prevents today's exact failure class |
| 2 | `shift-left(pre-push): cargo test --doc` | § 6.2 | 5 min | low | high |
| 3 | `fix(ship): invalidate git-push step when HEAD is ahead of origin` | § 6.3 | 30 min | low | high — removes v0.5.71-class pain |
| 4 | `fix(shared.just): CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 to match sccache config` | § 6.4 | 15 min + validation | medium | medium — root-causes Bug B |
| 5 | `refactor(scripts): promote ci-pipeline.rs to a workspace binary` | § 6.5.B | 90 min | medium | medium — eliminates Heisenbug class |

Commits 1 + 2 + 3 together form the "fast pass" — ~45 min of
surgery, addresses the three highest-pain items from the v0.5.71
retrospective.

---

## 11. Open Questions

- **Should `cargo machete` join pre-push?**  ~200 ms cost, catches
  Dependabot-orphan deps.  Defer until after Commits 1–3 land and we see
  whether the existing pre-push is already painful enough.
- **Should pre-push grow a `--fast` mode?**  `just lint-pre-push-fast`
  that skips the clippy trio on the grounds that pre-commit already ran
  them?  Probably not — `--no-verify` bypass makes the backstop
  worthwhile.
- **Windows pre-push parity.**  The Unix `scripts/hooks/pre-push` + shell
  script pattern doesn't extend cleanly to Windows.  Today Windows
  contributors implicitly rely on CI.  Acceptable while maintainer is
  the primary Windows user, reassess if contributor base grows.
