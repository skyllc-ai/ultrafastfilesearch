# UFFS Feature Flag and Dependency Policy

UFFS keeps **feature behavior additive** and **dependency duplication
audited** so that downstream consumers can pick the smallest viable
subset without surprises and the supply chain stays inspectable on
every commit.  This document is the project's **feature + dependency
contract**: it codifies *which* feature flags exist, *what each
guarantees*, *how* a new feature is introduced, and *which*
cross-version dependency duplications the workspace accepts and why.

For the per-crate strategy that produced the current posture, see
[`../../dev/architecture/code_clean/phase_8_feature_flags_dependency_hygiene_implementation_plan.md`](../../dev/architecture/code_clean/phase_8_feature_flags_dependency_hygiene_implementation_plan.md)
*(local-only — internal plan)*.

## 1  The rule

Stated as a one-liner contributors can quote:

> **Every feature is additive (enabling never removes an item).
> Every default feature has a written justification.  Every
> optional dep is reachable via `dep:<name>` and at least one
> `#[cfg(feature = "…")]` use-site.  Every cross-version
> dependency duplicate is either tracked in `deny.toml [bans].skip-tree`
> with a one-line reason, or accepted by the workspace-wide
> `multiple-versions = "warn"` posture and documented in §5.**

The categories:

| Category | Pattern | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| **F1 — additive, default-on** | Adds modules / items / deps; the default consumer keeps the historical surface | **KEEP** | Disabling is the consumer's deliberate "shrink the surface" choice (e.g. `uffs-client::async`) |
| **F2 — additive, default-off** | Adds modules / items / deps; opt-in chooses to accept a cost (binary size, syscall surface, build time) | **KEEP** | Default-off only when the cost is observable to a *thin* consumer (e.g. `uffs-cli::mcp-http-probe` keeps `ws2_32.dll` unlinked) |
| **F3 — orthogonal capability** | Two features compose without interaction (no `&&` cfg, no feature-on-feature ladder) | **KEEP** | Currently none — preserved as a category for future capability splits |
| **F4 — subtractive** | Disabling removes items the default consumer *had* | **FORBIDDEN** | Breaks Cargo's "feature unification" guarantee.  **Fix:** invert the polarity — make the *new* behavior the feature and the *legacy* behavior the default. |
| **F5 — feature-on-feature stack** | `foo = ["bar"]` where `bar` itself gates non-trivial deps | **REVIEW** | Document the cascade in each gated feature's rustdoc; verify no surprise dep activation |

Test code is exempt from the additivity rule — see
[`clippy.toml`](../../../clippy.toml) `allow-*-in-tests = true` and the
test-substitution boundary documented in
[`panic_policy.md` §1](panic_policy.md).

## 2  The lint posture

Phase 8 introduces **no new clippy lints**.  Feature and dependency
hygiene is enforced through six complementary tools wired into the
pre-push gate and CI:

| Tool | What it catches | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `cargo deny check` | License violations, advisories, source bans, multiple-version *deny*-level dups | `deny.toml` + `.github/workflows/pr-fast.yml::security` |
| `cargo machete` | Unused direct deps in any crate's `[dependencies]` | Pre-push gate + `pr-fast.yml::security` |
| `cargo vet` | Unaudited crate-versions in the dep graph | `supply-chain/{config,audits,imports.lock}.toml` + `pr-fast.yml::security` |
| `cargo tree --workspace -d` | Cross-version duplicate inventory | Surfaced by `scripts/dev/feature_dep_audit.sh --with-cargo`; no hard gate (workspace runs `multiple-versions = "warn"`) |
| `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` | Broken intra-doc links inside `# Features` sections | Pre-push gate (`rustdoc`) + `pr-fast.yml::docs` |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --no-default-features --no-deps -- -D warnings` | **Feature-additivity regressions** — `pub`/`pub(crate)` items reachable only when feature X is on but not themselves `#[cfg(feature = "X")]`-gated (manifests as `dead_code` warnings + unfulfilled `expect` warnings when feature X is off) | Pre-push gate (`lint-ci-no-default` — Phase 8e) + `pr-fast.yml::clippy-no-default` |

The sixth tool — `lint-ci-no-default` — is the Phase 8e regression
guard (issue #295).  It mirrors the existing `lint-ci` gate
(`--all-features -D warnings`) but swaps in `--no-default-features`,
so the pair establishes the **additivity invariant**: every item
reachable only with feature X must compile cleanly both with feature X
off AND with all features on.  Without this gate, the `--all-features`
build masks the dead-code warning the `--no-default-features` build
emits, and additivity regresses silently.

`deny.toml` is configured at:

```toml
[bans]
multiple-versions = "warn"  # NOT "deny" — see §5 for rationale
wildcards         = "allow"
skip-tree         = [ … ]   # see §5
```

The `multiple-versions = "warn"` choice is deliberate (§5).  CI
remains green when a new transitive dup appears; the audit script
`scripts/dev/feature_dep_audit.sh --with-cargo` is the human-driven
re-baselining step that decides per-group whether to add a
`skip-tree` entry or upstream a fix.

## 3  Feature flag contract (playbook §988)

Every feature added to the workspace must document the four-line
contract in **both** the crate's root rustdoc (`# Features` section)
**and** as a block comment above the `[features]` block in
`Cargo.toml`:

```text
1. What it enables  — which module / item / subcommand / binary
2. What deps it adds — `dep:<name>` gating + transitive feature pulls
3. API shape impact — additive (default) | subtractive (forbidden)
4. Semver claim     — adding items behind it is non-breaking;
                      removing items behind it is breaking
```

The rustdoc section also documents **why the default is on or off**.
A default-on feature is breaking-on-disable; the rationale must
explain who the deliberate `default-features = false` consumer is.
A default-off feature must explain what cost the default consumer
avoids (binary size, syscall surface, build time, compile time).

Cross-link contract:

- The crate's `# Features` section links to this policy doc.
- The Cargo.toml `[features]` block comment links to the rustdoc
  section.
- The crate's `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` sets `all-features = true`
  so docs.rs renders every feature's gated items with their `#[doc(cfg)]`
  badge.

See `crates/uffs-client/src/lib.rs`, `crates/uffs-mcp/src/lib.rs`,
and `crates/uffs-cli/src/main.rs` for the three reference
implementations.

## 4  Dependency hygiene rules

### 4.1  Direct deps

Every direct dep in a crate's `[dependencies]` table must be referenced
by at least one source file in that crate's `src/` tree.  `cargo
machete` enforces this on every push.  A crate that only uses a dep
transitively (e.g. for trait imports re-exported from another internal
crate) must *not* list it as a direct dep — that creates a cycle hazard
during dep upgrades.

### 4.2  Workspace pinning

Every direct dep is pinned at the workspace level in `Cargo.toml
[workspace.dependencies]` with an explicit `default-features` choice.
Per-crate manifests use `.workspace = true` so version drift is
impossible.  The two exceptions:

- **Path-with-version overrides** (`uffs-cli`'s `uffs-client = { path
  = "../uffs-client", version = "0.5.x", default-features = false }`)
  — workspace inheritance cannot override `default-features`, so the
  consumer crate must spell out the override explicitly.  Justified
  inline in the consumer Cargo.toml.
- **Internal crate path-with-version pins** for `cargo package`
  validation — required for the release-automation plan (R6).

### 4.3  Optional deps

Every `optional = true` dep must be reachable via `dep:<name>` in at
least one feature activation, and the dep must have at least one
`#[cfg(feature = "…")]` use-site in the crate's `src/`.  An optional
dep without a `dep:` reference (or with one but no `cfg` use-site) is
dead weight and fails the audit.

### 4.4  Consumer-side `default-features = false` overrides

A crate that depends on an internal crate may drop default features
when:

1. The dropped feature is documented as **default-on for compatibility,
   off for binary-size discipline** (the canonical `uffs-client::async`
   pattern).
2. The consumer adds a comment in its own Cargo.toml explaining the
   override and what is lost.

The current accepted overrides are tracked by
`scripts/dev/feature_dep_audit.sh` and listed in the §"Consumer-side
`default-features = false` overrides" section of the captured
baseline.

### 4.5  Default features on internal crates

A new `default = ["…"]` on a workspace crate requires:

1. A rustdoc rationale in the `# Features` section of the crate.
2. Verification that every internal consumer either inherits the
   default cleanly or overrides with documented intent.
3. A line in §6's decisions log of this doc.

Removing an existing default is a breaking change and must follow the
workspace release-cadence policy (release-automation §R5).

---

## 5  Cross-version duplicate acceptance criteria

The workspace ships `multiple-versions = "warn"` (not `"deny"`)
deliberately.  Three reasons:

1. **Polars commit pinning.**  `crates/uffs-polars` consumes a git-rev
   pin of `pola-rs/polars` (see `crates/uffs-polars/Cargo.toml`); each
   bump rotates which foundational crates land at which version
   (hashbrown 0.15→0.17, foldhash 0.1→0.2, getrandom 0.2→0.4).  A
   `deny`-level multiple-versions ban would force a skip-tree entry on
   every polars bump — a maintenance hazard the warn-level posture
   sidesteps cleanly.
2. **RustCrypto family fragmentation.**  `aes-gcm 0.10` pulls
   `crypto-common 0.1` + `cpufeatures 0.2` while `sha2 0.11` pulls
   `crypto-common 0.2` + `cpufeatures 0.3`.  Aligning these requires a
   coordinated `aes-gcm` + `sha2` major-version bump, owned by the
   security lane, not the dep-hygiene lane.
3. **`thiserror` / `signal-hook` / `itertools` minor-version splits.**
   Transitive deps frequently pin minor versions; absent an upstream
   coordination signal, accepting both versions is cheaper than
   forking.

The `deny.toml [bans].skip-tree` is the **opt-in** acceptance list —
entries documented inline with a one-line reason.  Crates surfaced by
`cargo tree -d` but absent from skip-tree are accepted by the
workspace-wide warn posture; Phase 8 captured the inventory and the
acceptance is documented here.

### 5.1  Inventory at Phase 8 close (SHA `4c6ffcff4`)

12 distinct duplicate-version groups, partitioned as:

| Group | Versions | Skip-tree status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `foldhash` | 0.1.5, 0.2.0 | **listed** (`foldhash@0.1`) | hashbrown 0.15 transitive |
| `getrandom` | 0.2.17, 0.3.4, 0.4.2 | **listed** (`getrandom@0.2`, `getrandom@0.3`) | ring + polars transitive |
| `hashbrown` | 0.15.5, 0.16.1, 0.17.1 | **listed** (`hashbrown@0.15`) | polars transitive |
| `itertools` | 0.13.0, 0.14.0 | **listed** (`itertools@0.13`) | polars transitive |
| `block-buffer` | 0.10.4, 0.12.0 | warn-only | RustCrypto `digest` 0.10 vs 0.11 |
| `cpufeatures` | 0.2.17, 0.3.0 | warn-only | RustCrypto `sha2` 0.10 vs 0.11 |
| `crypto-common` | 0.1.7, 0.2.1 | warn-only | RustCrypto `digest` 0.10 vs 0.11 |
| `digest` | 0.10.7, 0.11.2 | warn-only | RustCrypto `sha2` 0.10 vs 0.11 |
| `rand` | 0.9.4, 0.10.1 | warn-only | polars vs `rand_core` 0.6 vs 0.9/0.10 chain |
| `rand_chacha` | 0.9.0, 0.10.0 | warn-only | follows `rand` split |
| `rand_core` | 0.6.4, 0.9.5, 0.10.1 | warn-only | follows `rand` split |
| `sha2` | 0.10.9, 0.11.0 | warn-only | RustCrypto major-bump split |

Rerun `scripts/dev/feature_dep_audit.sh --with-cargo` to refresh the
inventory; any *new* group not in the table above is a finding that
needs a one-line decision (add to skip-tree with rationale, or upstream
a coordination fix).

## 6  Per-crate feature registry (as of 2026-05-19)

| Crate | Feature | Default? | Activates | Optional deps gated | Use-sites |
|---|---|:---:|---|---|---:|
| `uffs-cli` | `mcp-http-probe` | no | `commands::system_status` probe path | — | 4 |
| `uffs-client` | `async` | yes | `connect::*` modules + async tests | `dep:tokio` | 6 |
| `uffs-mcp` | `streamable-http` | yes | `pub mod http` + `uffs-mcp-http` binary + `mcp_serve` helper | `dep:axum`, `dep:tower-service`, `rmcp/transport-streamable-http-server` | 5 |

**Total active:** 3 feature flags across 3 of 14 crates.

The other 11 crates are intentionally feature-less — every `pub` item
is unconditionally available.  This keeps the cross-crate dep graph
simple and the publishable-leaf surface (`uffs-time`, `uffs-text`,
`uffs-broker-protocol`) deterministic.

---

## 7  Anti-patterns

The audit explicitly checks for and rejects:

- **Subtractive feature** — disabling removes a `pub` item the default
  consumer had.  Breaks Cargo feature unification (any other workspace
  consumer that enables the feature wins; the "disabled" consumer
  silently re-acquires the item).  **Fix:** invert polarity — default
  is the *legacy* shape; the feature gates the *new* shape.
- **Default-on without justification** — a `default = ["foo"]` line
  without an explanatory rustdoc + Cargo.toml comment.  **Fix:** write
  the four-line §988 contract (§3 above) or remove the default.
- **Optional dep without a `dep:` reference** — `optional = true` in
  `[dependencies]` but no feature carries `dep:<name>`.  Dead weight;
  the dep compiles into every consumer's lockfile but never participates
  in the build graph.  **Fix:** add the `dep:` gating, or remove the
  `optional` and the dep itself.
- **Feature-on-feature without rustdoc cascade** — `foo = ["bar"]`
  where `bar` itself pulls non-trivial deps, without a rustdoc note
  explaining what enabling `foo` transitively activates.  **Fix:**
  expand the `# Features` section to list the cascade.
- **Cross-version duplicate not in §5.1** — a `cargo tree -d` row not
  matching any group in the inventory above.  **Fix:** add a skip-tree
  entry with a one-line rationale, OR upstream a coordination fix, OR
  document the warn-only acceptance in §5.1 of this doc.
- **Direct dep without a use-site** — fails `cargo machete` at
  pre-push.  **Fix:** add the use-site, or remove the dep.

---

## 8  Audit cadence

- **On every workspace-wide refactor phase** (Phases 1–N of the
  playbook) re-run `scripts/dev/feature_dep_audit.sh --with-cargo` and
  confirm the per-crate registry in §6 and the dup inventory in §5.1
  are current.
- **On every new feature flag** — open a design review: justify F1/F2,
  write the four-line §988 contract in rustdoc + Cargo.toml, add a row
  to §6, append to §9.
- **On every new `dep:<name>` activation** — verify `cargo machete`
  stays green and the use-site count is non-zero before merge.
- **On every polars commit-pin bump** — rerun the audit; expect
  duplicate-version churn in `hashbrown` / `foldhash` / `rand_*`
  families; update §5.1 if a new group surfaces or an existing one
  goes away.
- **Annually** as part of the workspace-health review.
