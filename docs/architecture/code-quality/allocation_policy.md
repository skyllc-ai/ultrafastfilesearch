# UFFS Allocation Policy

UFFS enforces a **clone-and-allocation discipline in production code** to keep
search-result and parse hot paths predictable.  This document is the project's
**allocation contract**: it codifies *when* a `.clone()`, `format!()`, or
heap-string operation is acceptable, *what shape* it must take, and *how* a
contributor justifies one inline.

The companion docs:
- [`panic_policy.md`](panic_policy.md) — when panics / `unwrap` / `expect` are
  acceptable.
- [`lint-posture.md`](lint-posture.md) — full lint configuration (rustfmt,
  rustc, clippy, rustdoc, cargo-deny).

For the per-crate strategy that produced the current posture, see
[`../../dev/architecture/code_clean/phase_6_ownership_borrowing_allocation_implementation_plan.md`](../../dev/architecture/code_clean/phase_6_ownership_borrowing_allocation_implementation_plan.md)
*(local-only — internal plan)*.

## 1  The rule

Stated as a one-liner contributors can quote:

> **Hot paths (per-record / per-row / per-query) never allocate
> defensively.  Cold paths (error context, log lines, one-time setup)
> may allocate freely.  Every `.clone()` / `format!()` / `to_owned()`
> in production code must fit one of the five blessed categories
> (α / β / γ / δ / ε), and δ is a bug.**

The categories:

| Category | Pattern | Verdict | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------:|-------|
| **α — Arc clone** | `Arc::clone(&x)` / `x.clone()` where `x: Arc<T>` | **KEEP** | Refcount bump for `tokio::spawn`, broadcast channels, fan-out of immutable data |
| **β — Ownership fence** | Caller has `&T` but the called API needs `T` (stores / mutates / consumes) | **KEEP** | The only safe shape given the surrounding ownership graph |
| **γ — Error / log context** | `String` / `PathBuf` carried into an error variant or log line | **KEEP** | Error paths are cold; allocation cost is dominated by the error itself |
| **δ — Hot-path anti-pattern** | Clone of `String` / `Vec<T>` inside a per-record / per-query loop that could be eliminated by restructuring ownership | **FIX** | Refactor the call site; never suppress |
| **ε — Test helper** | `#[cfg(test)]`-only allocation | **KEEP** | Out of scope; test code is exempt from the discipline |

Test code is exempt — see
[`clippy.toml`](../../../clippy.toml) `allow-*-in-tests = true`.
This split mirrors the panic-policy test/prod boundary described in
[`panic_policy.md` §1](panic_policy.md) and
[`lint-posture.md` §4](lint-posture.md).

---

## 2  The lint posture

Five workspace Clippy lints at `deny` level (out of 12 clone-family lints
total) enforce the rule mechanically:

```toml
[workspace.lints.clippy]
redundant_clone           = "deny"  # Avoid unnecessary clones
clone_on_ref_ptr          = "deny"  # Use Arc::clone(&x) form (not x.clone())
cloned_instead_of_copied  = "deny"  # Prefer .copied() for Copy types
inefficient_to_string     = "deny"  # Use format!("{}", x) over x.to_string()
unnecessary_to_owned      = "deny"  # Avoid .to_owned() on already-owned types
```

The remaining seven (`implicit_clone`, `map_clone`, `assigning_clones`,
`str_to_string`, `string_to_string`, `iter_overeager_cloned`,
`unnecessary_owned_empty_strings`) sit at `warn` and are upgraded ad hoc
when a new pattern surfaces.

`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --message-format=json` emits **zero**
diagnostics for these 12 lints on every commit landing in `main`.  Any new
clone-family diagnostic blocks the pre-push gate.

Release builds also set `opt-level = 3` + `lto = "thin"` (see
`@/Users/rnio/Private/Github/UltraFastFileSearch/Cargo.toml`
`[profile.release]`), so the compiler eliminates dead `.clone()`s the
audit might have missed.

---

## 3  The five categories — in depth

### 3.1  Category α — Arc clone

**Pattern:**

```rust
let cb = shared_callback.clone();           // Arc<dyn Fn(...)>
tokio::spawn(async move { run_task(cb).await });
```

**Verdict:** KEEP.

`Arc::clone(&shared_callback)` is an 8-byte atomic refcount bump.  The cost
is roughly equivalent to a function-call prologue and orders of magnitude
cheaper than any structural alternative (channel, mutex, etc.).

**Workspace convention:**
- `clone_on_ref_ptr = "deny"` enforces the explicit `Arc::clone(&x)` form
  for clarity.  `x.clone()` on an `Arc<T>` is a Clippy error.
- Spawned tasks may hold `Arc<T>` for an unbounded duration — the refcount
  decrements when the task drops the captured value.

**Examples from the workspace:**
- `crates/uffs-mft/src/reader/multi_drive/{dataframe,index}.rs` —
  `shared_callback.clone()` per spawned per-drive worker task.
- `crates/uffs-mft/src/io/readers/parallel/to_index_parallel.rs` —
  `rx.clone()`, `bitmap_arc.clone()` for worker channels.
- `crates/uffs-daemon/src/cache/pressure.rs` — `sender.clone()` for the
  pressure-watcher spawn.

---

### 3.2  Category β — Ownership fence

**Pattern:**

```rust
fn apply_usn_patch(body_arc: &Arc<DriveCompactIndex>, changes: &[UsnChange])
    -> Option<(Arc<DriveCompactIndex>, PatchStats)>
{
    // Deep-clone the inner DriveCompactIndex so the patch loop mutates
    // the clone — never the live Arc that concurrent readers are
    // observing.
    let mut owned: DriveCompactIndex = (**body_arc).clone();
    let stats = uffs_core::compact_loader::apply_usn_patch(&mut owned, changes);
    Some((Arc::new(owned), stats))
}
```

**Verdict:** KEEP.

The caller has a shared reference (`&Arc<T>`).  Producing the new patched
state requires owning a `T`.  Clone is the only safe path — alternatives
(unsafe transmute, atomic CAS on the inner pointer) sacrifice the
copy-on-write semantics the daemon relies on for lock-free readers.

**Workspace convention:**
- The reason text must explain *why* the clone is unavoidable (typically
  one of: copy-on-write semantics, per-worker isolation, API consumes by
  value).
- Cross-reference the consuming API's `&mut` signature if the clone exists
  to satisfy a `&mut self` boundary.

**Examples from the workspace:**
- `crates/uffs-daemon/src/cache/shard.rs:538` — `DriveCompactIndex` clone
  for USN patch application (copy-on-write).
- `crates/uffs-core/src/search/query/numeric_top_n.rs:606` —
  `search_filters.clone()` per parallel worker (per-worker isolation).
- `crates/uffs-core/src/compact.rs:179, 289` — `offsets.clone()` for
  CSR-build scratch buffer (single-writer scratch).
- `crates/uffs-mft/src/io/readers/pipelined.rs:592, 596` —
  `extent_map.clone()` per pipelined reader (one-time per-reader setup).

---

### 3.3  Category γ — Error / log context

**Pattern:**

```rust
fn load_drive(path: &Path, drive: &Drive) -> Result<...> {
    // ...
    Err(MftError::FileOpen {
        path: path.to_path_buf(),       // γ: own the path past the error site
        drive: drive.letter,
        source: io_err,
    })
}
```

**Verdict:** KEEP.

Error paths are cold by definition — they only fire when something has
already gone wrong.  The cost of allocating a `PathBuf` / `String` for
context is dominated by the cost of the failure itself (system call, lock
release, retry logic).

**Workspace convention:**
- The clone / allocation must be inside an error-construction arm, a `log!`
  macro, or a `tracing!` event.
- Reason text in the surrounding code can be brief — the *category* is
  self-evident from the error/log context.

**Examples from the workspace:**
- `crates/uffs-core/src/compact_loader.rs:434` — `MftSource::File(path.clone(), ...)`
  for source-tagged error context.
- `crates/uffs-mft/src/reader/index_read.rs:62` — `file_path.clone()` to own
  the path past the error site.
- `crates/uffs-daemon/src/handler.rs:393, 416-417, 187, 287, ...` —
  per-request JSON-RPC response packaging (`agg.buckets.clone()`,
  `val.clone()` for `serde_json::from_value` consumption).

---

### 3.4  Category δ — Hot-path anti-pattern

**Pattern (anti-pattern — DO NOT WRITE):**

```rust
for drive in &drives {
    search_filters.resolve_ext_ids_for_drive(drive);
    // ...
    // Defensive clone "in case we re-borrow `search_filters` later"
    for &ext_id in &search_filters.resolved_ext_ids.clone() {  // ⚠ δ
        // ... body never actually touches search_filters
    }
}
```

**Verdict:** FIX.

If the inner loop body does not actually re-borrow the parent state, the
clone is dead weight — a per-iteration allocation that the borrow checker
would accept without it.  These are the only category that **must** be
refactored, not suppressed.

**The fix is structural, not lint-driven.**  Common shapes:
- **Borrow narrower:** drop the clone; the immutable borrow scope ends when
  the inner loop returns to the outer.
- **Take by value:** if the caller owns the data, change the API to consume
  by value rather than clone-then-consume.
- **Static intern:** replace per-row `format!("X:", drive)` with a 26-entry
  `[&'static str; 26]` lookup table.
- **`Cow<'_, str>`:** for APIs that take `&str` but sometimes need an owned
  variant (e.g. case-folding), return `Cow<'_, str>` so the caller pays
  only when needed.

**Workspace convention:**
- δ fixes land as **standalone commits** with `refs #193` and a
  one-paragraph rationale explaining the new ownership invariant.
- Reason text at the refactored site must document the new (correct)
  borrow invariant so future audits don't re-introduce the clone.

**Examples (all fixed in Phase 6):**
- Phase 6c (PR #282): `path_only_top_n.rs:516`, `path_sorted_top_n.rs:252`
  — defensive `Vec<u16>::clone()` dropped (immutable borrow narrows).
- Phase 6d (PR #283): `path_resolver/fast.rs:add_path_column_with_dir_suffix`
  — per-row `format!` replaced with in-place `String::push_str`.
- Phase 6d (PR #283): `search/dataframe_convert.rs:display_rows_to_dataframe`
  — per-row `format!("{}:", drive)` replaced with `[&str; 26]` lookup.
- Phase 6e (PR #284): `search/dispatch.rs:fold_needle` — duplicated
  `to_owned()` pattern replaced with `Cow<'_, str>` helper (case-sensitive
  path now zero-alloc).

---

### 3.5  Category ε — Test helper

**Pattern:**

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    fn file_row(path: &str, size: u64) -> DisplayRow {
        DisplayRow::new(0, DriveLetter::C, path.to_owned(), size, ...)  // ε
    }
}
```

**Verdict:** KEEP (out of scope).

Test code is exempt from the allocation discipline.  Test fixtures and
helpers may clone freely so the test author can concentrate on the
*behavior* under test.

**Workspace convention:**
- `clippy.toml` carries `allow-*-in-tests = true` (covers `unwrap_used`,
  `expect_used`, `panic`, plus implicit Clippy test-context exemptions).
- ε sites are **not** counted in the per-crate audit numbers.
- New `#[cfg(test)]` code requires no `.clone()` justification.

---

## 4  The per-site annotation contract

Every prod `.clone()` / `format!()` / `to_owned()` site must satisfy one of:

1. **Self-evident category α (`Arc::clone(&x)` form):** no comment required —
   the explicit `Arc::clone(&x)` syntax is its own annotation.
2. **Category β / γ:** a 1–3 line `//` comment above (or trailing) the call
   site explaining *why* the alternative (`&T`, in-place mutation, etc.)
   doesn't work for this site.  Reason quality is checked at code review,
   not by lint.
3. **Category δ refactor:** comment block at the refactored site documents
   the new (correct) borrow / ownership invariant and cross-references the
   Phase 6 sub-phase that landed the fix.

The bar for reason quality is the same as the panic policy's
`#[expect(reason = "...")]` annotations: a future contributor (or auditor)
reading the comment should be able to reconstruct why the clone exists
without paging in the full surrounding module.

---

## 5  Audit cadence

A standalone shell helper produces the workspace allocation inventory:

```bash
bash scripts/dev/clone_alloc_audit.sh
```

The script counts:
- `.clone()` calls per crate, split by `prod` vs `test`
- `format!` invocations per crate, split by `prod` vs `test`
- `to_string` / `to_owned` invocations per crate, split by `prod` vs `test`
- The top-10 per-file `.clone()` hotspots in production code
- The top-10 per-file `format!` hotspots in production code

The script is `Bash 5.x` + `rg` (ripgrep).  Run before opening any PR that
touches a hot-path module; the absolute counts should not regress.

For the audit framework and per-site classification dump, see the
phase-6 baseline directory under `docs/dev/baseline/2026-05-12/`
*(local-only — generated by `clone_alloc_audit.sh`)*.

---

## 6  Workspace cross-references

Every site that touches the allocation policy must cross-reference the
others to keep the contract auditable:

- `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.lints.clippy]` carries doc comments on each
  clone-family lint pointing at this file.
- `clippy.toml` carries a doc comment pointing at this file and at
  `panic_policy.md`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md §Allocation policy` summarises the rule and links here.
- `panic_policy.md §1` covers the test/prod split that this doc inherits.
- `lint-posture.md §4` covers the broader test-vs-prod split.
