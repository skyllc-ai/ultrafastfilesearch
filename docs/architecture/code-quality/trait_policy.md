# UFFS Trait, Generic, and Dispatch Policy

> **Companion documents:**
> [`panic_policy.md`](panic_policy.md) (Phase 5e),
> [`allocation_policy.md`](allocation_policy.md) (Phase 6f),
> [`lint-posture.md`](lint-posture.md).

## 1  The rule

A trait must satisfy at least one of:

- **[J1]** multiple meaningful implementations,
- **[J2]** a test-substitution boundary (prod impl + test fake),
- **[J3]** a stable extension surface documented in rustdoc, or
- **[J4]** high-level / infrastructure decoupling at a clean architectural boundary.

Otherwise it's decoration — demote to a concrete type.

Generics stay **local** (callers see them only when they benefit).  Use **`dyn`** for plugin / runtime / OS-abstraction boundaries; use **static dispatch** for closed sets and hot-path closures.  Seal `pub trait`s only when external impls would break a documented invariant; prefer **structural sealing** (private fields on the return type) over an explicit `Sealed` supertrait when the trait's return type already carries the invariant.

## 2  The lint posture

The workspace enforces this policy through five clippy lints in `Cargo.toml [workspace.lints.clippy]`:

| Lint | Level | Catches | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clippy::type_complexity` | `deny` | Trait-bound / generic-bound chains over the default complexity threshold (250) | Phase 6 (carried over) |
| `clippy::too_many_arguments` | `deny` | `fn` signatures with more than the default 7 parameters | Phase 7f |
| `clippy::trait_duplication_in_bounds` | `deny` | Duplicate trait bounds on the same generic parameter (e.g. `T: Foo + Foo + Bar`) | Phase 7f |
| `clippy::wrong_self_convention` | `deny` | Inherent-method naming that violates the `as_*` / `into_*` / `to_*` / `from_*` conventions | Phase 7f |
| `clippy::multiple_bound_locations` | `warn` | Bounds split between `<T: …>` and `where T: …` for the same `T` | Phase 7f |

Per-site overrides (`#[expect(clippy::too_many_arguments, reason = "…")]`) are permitted only when the function genuinely needs more than 7 parameters and the rationale is documented inline.

Tests are relaxed via `clippy.toml`'s `allow-*-in-tests` settings (see [`lint-posture.md`](lint-posture.md)).

## 3  The four-criterion trait justification taxonomy

A `pub trait` or `pub(crate) trait` is justified iff at least one of J1–J4 holds.

### 3.1  [J1] — Multiple meaningful implementations

Two or more prod impls of the trait exist in the workspace **on `main`** (not hypothetical "someday we might add another impl").  Examples:

- `JournalSource` (`uffs-daemon::cache::journal_loop`): `MacStubJournalSource` (always-empty on Mac/Linux) + `WindowsJournalSource` (`FSCTL_READ_USN_JOURNAL` on Windows).
- `RuntimeDir` (`uffs-security`): `UnixRuntimeDir` (`0o600` + `kill(pid, 0)`) + `WindowsRuntimeDir` (`FILE_SHARE_NONE` + `OpenProcess`).
- `FormatRow` (`uffs-format`): `uffs_core::search::backend::DisplayRow` (offset-into-path) + `uffs_client::protocol::response::SearchRow` (standalone `String`).

### 3.2  [J2] — Test-substitution boundary

A production impl exists, and at least one test fake under `#[cfg(test)]` or `tests/*.rs` exists.  The trait is the deliberate seam between prod side-effects and deterministic test fixtures.  Examples:

- `BodyLoader` (`uffs-daemon::cache::body_loader`): `DiskBodyLoader` prod + fakes in `tests/body_loader_fakes.rs`.
- `FileReader` (`uffs-core::aggregate::verify`): `DaemonFileReader` prod (in `uffs-daemon`) + `MockReader` test fake.
- The full `uffs-daemon::cache::*` 9-trait cluster: `BackgroundIoPriority`, `BodyLoader`, `CacheCleaner`, `CursorStore`, `JournalSource`, `PatchSink`, `Prefetch`, `PressureSignal`, `WorkingSetTrim`.  Each holds an OS-side-effect that needs stubbable substitution in tests.

### 3.3  [J3] — Stable extension surface

The trait's rustdoc explicitly invites external impls and documents the extension contract.  Examples:

- `FileReader`: *"External crates may implement FileReader to plug in alternate I/O strategies (e.g. async readers, network-backed readers) without changes to uffs-core."*
- `FormatRow`: *"consumers can plug their own row representation if they ever need to (e.g. a future Parquet-shaped row backend)."*

J3 is a stronger claim than J1: J1 says "multiple impls exist"; J3 says "we welcome more from outside our workspace".

### 3.4  [J4] — High-level / infrastructure decoupling

The trait crosses a clean architectural boundary — typically from a library-layer service down to an infrastructure-layer driver — and the consumer side is documented to be testable / swappable independently.  Examples in the UFFS workspace overlap heavily with J2 (the cache hook traits); pure J4 sites are rare.

### 3.5  Demotion criterion

A trait satisfying **none** of J1–J4 → demote to a concrete type and replace usages.  The single Phase-7b demotion (`DirCacheExt` → free `dir_cache_with_capacity(n)` function) is the canonical example: single impl, no test fake, `pub(crate)`, no extension surface, no decoupling — pure method-sugar that required every caller to write `use … DirCacheExt as _;`.

## 4  The generic-function taxonomy

Five categories partition every prod-path `fn<T: …>` site:

| Category | Description | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **[G1-LOCAL]**     | Generic-ness contained within the function body; callers do not have to think about `T` (e.g. `<T: Iterator<Item = …>>` consumed once internally) | KEEP |
| **[G2-USEFUL]**    | Generic-ness extends to the call site but the caller benefits (e.g. `impl AsRef<Path>` lets callers pass `&str` / `String` / `&Path` / `PathBuf` without explicit conversion) | KEEP |
| **[G3-SPREAD]**    | Generic-ness has spread to multiple call sites without benefit; all call sites use the same concrete type | **FIX** — refactor to concrete |
| **[G4-CASCADING]** | Generic-ness forced upstream into structs / traits that did not need it | **FIX** — narrow scope or accept the bound at the source struct |
| **[G5-CLOSURE]**   | Generic `<F: Fn…>` parameter at a callsite that benefits from inlining (hot-path filter, comparator, progress callback) | KEEP |

The Phase 7c audit found **zero G3-SPREAD and zero G4-CASCADING sites** across all 127 prod generic-fn sites — the workspace's existing `impl AsRef<Path>` / `<W: Write>` / `<F: Fn…>` / `<D: AsRef<DriveCompactIndex> + Sync>` clusters are textbook G1/G2/G5 by construction.

## 5  The dispatch matrix

For each `dyn <Trait>` site:

| Category | Description | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **[D1-PLUGIN]**    | Pluggable backend / runtime registry (transport, encryption, OS abstraction) | KEEP |
| **[D2-HETERO]**    | Heterogeneous handler collection (`Box<dyn Read + Send>` for transport polymorphism; `&dyn Fn(…)` for runtime-selected callbacks; `Vec<Box<dyn Handler>>` for plugin registries) | KEEP |
| **[D3-NOOP]**      | `dyn Trait` used where the impl set is closed and single | **FIX** — refactor to concrete or `enum` |
| **[D4-VTBL-COST]** | `dyn Trait` on a hot path where monomorphization would inline a tight loop | **REVIEW** — measure first |

For each static-dispatch site that *could* be `dyn Trait`:

| Category | Description | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **[S1-MONOMORPH]**      | Performance-critical generic; monomorphization gives measurable inlining | KEEP |
| **[S2-OVER-MONOMORPH]** | Generic where monomorphization bloats binary size but inlining doesn't help | **REVIEW** — consider `dyn` |
| **[S3-CLOSED-SET]**     | Generic where only 2-3 impls exist and all are in this workspace | KEEP |

The Phase 7d audit found **40 true dispatch sites** (after dropping doc-comment matches from the raw 89): every site is D1-PLUGIN or D2-HETERO.  Zero D3-NOOP, zero D4-VTBL-COST, zero S2-OVER-MONOMORPH.

## 6  Seal/open decision tree

For each surviving `pub trait` (cross-crate-visible):

1. **Is the trait documented as an extension point?**  YES → **OPEN**.
2. **Is the trait's contract enforced structurally (private fields on the return type, no public constructor)?**  YES → **OPEN (effectively sealed)** — no explicit `Sealed` marker needed; document the structural reality in rustdoc.
3. **Could an external impl silently break a safety / correctness invariant?**  YES → **SEAL** with the explicit pattern below.
4. Otherwise → **OPEN** by default (the playbook §902-904 mantra is "controlled implementations", not "no implementations").

Explicit sealing pattern:

```rust
mod private { pub trait Sealed {} }
pub trait MyTrait: private::Sealed { /* ... */ }
impl private::Sealed for Impl1 {}
impl private::Sealed for Impl2 {}
```

Phase 7e decisions for the 3 surviving `pub trait`s:

| Trait | Crate | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FileReader` | `uffs-core::aggregate::verify` | **OPEN** | Phase 3b §3.7 reaffirmed.  Rustdoc invites external impls (J3). |
| `FormatRow` | `uffs-format::row` | **OPEN** | Phase 3b §3.7 reaffirmed.  Rustdoc documents the Parquet-shaped extension intent (J3). |
| `RuntimeDir` | `uffs-security::runtime_dir` | **OPEN (effectively sealed)** | Phase 7e new decision.  The trait's `create_owner_only` method returns a `RuntimeFile`, whose fields (`file: File`, `path: PathBuf`) are private — external code cannot construct a `RuntimeFile`, so external impls of `RuntimeDir` are structurally impossible without a public constructor.  No explicit `Sealed` marker is added; the structural seal points readers at the actual cause — `error[E0451]: field file of struct RuntimeFile is private` — rather than a derived `Sealed` supertrait. |

## 7  Per-trait registry (as of 2026-05-19)

| Trait | Crate | Visibility | Prod impls | Test fakes | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `FileReader` | `uffs-core` | `pub` | 1 (`DaemonFileReader`) | 1 (`MockReader`) | KEEP-[J2]+[J3] |
| `BackgroundIoPriority` | `uffs-daemon` | `pub(crate)` | 1 (`PlatformBackgroundIoPriority`) | 1 | KEEP-[J2] |
| `BodyLoader` | `uffs-daemon` | `pub(crate)` | 1 (`DiskBodyLoader`) | ≥1 (`tests/body_loader_fakes.rs`) | KEEP-[J2] |
| `CacheCleaner` | `uffs-daemon` | `pub(crate)` | 1 (`PlatformCacheCleaner`) | 1 | KEEP-[J2] |
| `JournalSource` | `uffs-daemon` | `pub(crate)` | 2 (`MacStubJournalSource` + `WindowsJournalSource`) | 1 (`FakeJournalSource`) | KEEP-[J1]+[J2] |
| `PatchSink` | `uffs-daemon` | `pub(crate)` | 1 | 1 | KEEP-[J2] |
| `CursorStore` | `uffs-daemon` | `pub(crate)` | 1 (`NullCursorStore`) + 1 future | 1 (`FakeCursorStore`) | KEEP-[J2] |
| `Prefetch` | `uffs-daemon` | `pub(crate)` | 1 (`PlatformPrefetch`) | 1 | KEEP-[J2] |
| `PressureSignal` | `uffs-daemon` | `pub(crate)` | 1 (`PlatformPressureSignal`) | 1 | KEEP-[J2] |
| `WorkingSetTrim` | `uffs-daemon` | `pub(crate)` | 1 (`PlatformWorkingSetTrim`) | 1 | KEEP-[J2] |
| `FormatRow` | `uffs-format` | `pub` | 2 (`DisplayRow` + `SearchRow`, in distinct crates) | 0 | KEEP-[J1]+[J3] |
| `RuntimeDir` | `uffs-security` | `pub` | 2 (`UnixRuntimeDir` + `WindowsRuntimeDir`) | 1 (`TestRuntimeDir`) | KEEP-[J1]+[J2] |
| ~~`DirCacheExt`~~ | ~~`uffs-core`~~ | ~~`pub(crate)`~~ | — | — | **DEMOTED** Phase 7b → `dir_cache_with_capacity` free fn (PR #289) |

**Total active:** 12 traits (3 `pub` cross-crate + 9 `pub(crate)` daemon hooks).

## 8  Anti-patterns

The audit explicitly checks for and rejects:

- **Decoration trait** — single impl, no test fake, no rustdoc-claimed extensibility.  Example: pre-7b `DirCacheExt` (single method, single impl on a type alias, required `use … DirCacheExt as _;` at every call site for zero substitution benefit).  **Fix:** demote to a free function.
- **`dyn Trait` on a 2-impl closed set** — the closed set should be an `enum` with explicit variants, not a heap-allocated trait object.  **Fix:** convert to `enum`; if the variant payloads differ in size by > 8×, `Box` the largest arm to keep `clippy::large_enum_variant` happy.
- **Generic spread without measurable benefit** — generic parameter that monomorphizes to 1-2 concrete types in practice and adds compile-time without runtime win.  **Fix:** demote to concrete; the lost ergonomic is rarely worth the compile-time cost.
- **Bound list copy-paste** — `impl<T: Trait1 + Trait2 + Send + Sync + 'static>` repeated across 5 fn sigs.  **Fix:** extract a supertrait bound on the trait itself, or use a trait alias (`trait MyBound: Trait1 + Trait2 + Send + Sync + 'static {}` + blanket impl).
- **Explicit `Sealed` marker where structural sealing suffices** — adds two lines per impl + a private module + a supertrait bound, but does not change error-message clarity or behavior when the return type already carries the invariant.  **Fix:** rely on the existing private-field structural seal; document it in the trait's rustdoc.

## 9  Audit cadence

- **On every workspace-wide refactor phase** (Phases 1–N of the playbook) re-run `scripts/dev/trait_generic_audit.sh` and confirm the per-trait registry in §7 above is current.
- **On every new `pub trait` introduced** — open a Phase-7-style review: justify J1/J2/J3/J4, decide seal-vs-open, document in §7.
- **On every new `pub(crate) trait` cluster** (e.g. a new memory-tiering subsystem with its own substitution surface) — re-run the audit script and add the trait to §7.
- **Annually** as part of the workspace-health review.
