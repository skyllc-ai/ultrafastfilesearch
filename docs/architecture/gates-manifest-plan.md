## Status (2026-05-06)

| Phase | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Plan + schema design | ✅ landed (PR #139) |
| 1 | Manifest + drift detector (no consumer changes) | ✅ landed (PR #140) |
| 2 | Codegen for `_lint_pre_push.sh` | ✅ landed (PR #141) |
| 3 | `pr-fast.yml` structural validator (revised from "codegen" — see §4.2 pivot) | ✅ landed (PR #143) |
| 3a | `_lint_fast.sh` codegen | ✅ landed (PR #144) |
| 3c (deferred) | gen-docs | ⏭ deferred (prose tables; §4.3 rationale) |

Closing all four phases brings the workspace to **zero hand-maintained
gate-set drift** between local hooks, CI workflows, and contributor
docs.  PR #138 (Phase W5/L1 closure of
`windows-clippy-and-linux-cross-plan.md`) was the proximate motivation:
the windows-check → windows-lint rename touched **6 files** in 5
distinct surfaces (workflow YAML, pre-push hook, pre-commit hook
comments, CONTRIBUTING.md table, dev-flow doc gate matrix,
supply-chain doc reference list) plus a CHANGELOG entry, and it took
two follow-up commits to catch every reference.  That class of pain
is what this manifest erases.

## 1. Problem

The current gate set is hand-maintained in **six** places that all need
to stay in lockstep:

| Surface | What it encodes | Drift modes |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/hooks/_lint_fast.sh` | pre-commit gate set | adding a gate without updating pre-push or CI; budget regressions |
| `scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh` | pre-push gate set, bucket assignments, fail-fast order | same as above plus bucket misclassification |
| `.github/workflows/pr-fast.yml` | CI job graph + `required` aggregator's `needs:` list | required-check name drift breaks branch protection silently |
| `just/test.just` (`lint-*` recipes) | manual invocations the hooks delegate to | recipe rename without hook update |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` four-layer table | contributor-facing doc | usually the LAST thing updated; lies for weeks |
| `docs/architecture/dev-flow.md` §3.2 gate matrix | architectural reference | same as above |

Drift is **mathematically inevitable** because:

1. Each new gate requires editing 4-6 files in a specific order.
2. Each rename / flag flip requires the same.
3. There is no automated check that the local hook actually runs the
   same set of gates that CI runs (only that each individually exits 0).
4. Reviewers cannot easily diff "what does pre-push catch?" against
   "what does CI catch?" — they have to mentally cross-reference 6 files.

**Recent evidence**:
- PR #138 W5.5/W5.6 flip: 6 file references to `windows-check` had to
  be updated to `windows-lint`.  Two follow-up commits caught the
  ones missed in the first pass (`dev-flow.md`, `supply-chain-posture.md`,
  `dev-flow-implementation-plan.md` design-rationale bullets).
- Tier 2 `windows-check` removal (W5 follow-on, same PR): 5 surface
  points across `tier-2.yml` alone (job block + 2 `needs:` lists +
  summary conditional + summary table line).  Plus 4 doc surfaces.
- Phase 2 (long ago) removed Windows xwin from pre-commit.  CONTRIBUTING.md
  still claimed it ran there until PR #138 caught the lie.

## 2. Goal

Single source of truth: **`scripts/ci/gates.toml`** defines every
gate (id, command, env, classification, expected runtime, tier
membership).  All consumers — pre-commit hook, pre-push hook, CI
workflow, contributor docs — are **generated from** this file.  CI
verifies generators are in sync (drift detector).

Adding a new gate becomes **one TOML edit + one regen command**.
Renaming a gate becomes the same.  The contributor docs auto-update.
The required-check name in CI's branch protection cannot drift from
what the workflow actually emits.

## 3. Manifest schema (`scripts/ci/gates.toml`)

```toml
# Top-level metadata
[manifest]
version = 1
generator_version = "..."  # bumps when the schema or generator output changes

    # Optional: also-generated doc tables, see Phase 3
]

# bucket-2 jobs.  Hooks AND CI's classify job both consume these so
# they stay in lockstep.

```

### Field semantics

- **`id`**: kebab-case identifier; primary key.  Stable across renames
  (renaming an `id` is a breaking change → manifest version bump).
- **`label`**: human-readable name surfaced in CI logs + hook output.
  Free-form; can change without breaking anything downstream.
- **`command`**: array form for safety (no shell-injection on
  whitespace-bearing args).  Generator quotes per target language.
- **`tiers`**: any subset of `{"pre-commit", "pre-push", "pr-fast", "tier-2"}`.
  Drives which generated files include this gate.
- **`gate_when`**: triggers the gate against a change-classification
  bit.  `always` = unconditional; `rust_changed` / `dep_changed` /
  `infra_changed` = exact match against the manifest's `[classification]`
  regexes; `code_changed` = OR of `rust|dep|infra` (matches the existing
  `_lint_pre_push.sh` semantics).
- **`hard`**: `true` = exit non-zero on missing tool; `false` =
  soft-skip + print install hint.  Mirrors existing hook behaviour.
- **`tool`**: the binary the hook checks for via `command -v`.  Used
  only for missing-tool detection.
- **`expected_runtime_secs`**: documentary; surfaced in generated
  comments for the budget table.  Not enforced.
- **`bucket`** (pre-push only): `"bg"` = bucket 1 (cheap, parallel,
  fire-and-forget); `"seq"` = bucket 2 (cargo-heavy, sequential
  fail-fast).  Mirrors existing `_lint_pre_push.sh` design.
- **`order`** (pre-push only, within bucket): integer ordering hint;
  bucket-2 cheapest-to-most-expensive.
- **`flag_template`**: optional reference to a shared flag bag
  (`prod_flags` / `test_flags` / `common_flags`) defined in
  `just/shared.just`.  Generators substitute the actual flag list at
  emit time so the strict-flag stack stays single-sourced.
- **`notes`**: free-form Markdown surfaced in the generated comment
  blocks.  Carries the rationale that lives today in long bash comment
  prefixes.

### Optional sections

- `[[platform_override]]`: per-target tweaks (e.g. `lint-ci-windows`
  uses `cargo xwin clippy` cross-compile, `lint-ci-linux-zig` uses
  `cargo-zigbuild clippy`).  Modeled as overrides on a base `[[gate]]`
  to keep the strict-flag stack single-sourced.

## 4. Generator interface

Three small generators, one per consumer.  Each is a Rust binary
under `scripts/ci/gen-*` (Rust because TOML parsing in bash is
fragile, and we already require a Rust toolchain for everything else).

### 4.1 `scripts/ci/gen-hooks` (Phase 2)

```
USAGE: gen-hooks [--check]

Reads scripts/ci/gates.toml.
Writes (or checks) scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh
and scripts/hooks/_lint_fast.sh.

EXIT:
  0  on emit (without --check), or on no-op (with --check)
  1  on diff (with --check) — file is out-of-sync with manifest
  2  on schema error (manifest invalid)

FLAGS:
  --check           Diff mode: do not write files; exit 1 if regen
                    would change them.  Used by CI drift detector.
  --tier <tier>     Restrict emit to one tier (pre-commit | pre-push).
  --verbose         Print per-gate emit decisions to stderr.
```

### 4.2 `scripts/ci/gen-workflow` (Phase 3) — structural validator only

```
USAGE: gen-workflow [--check]   # --write does not exist

Reads scripts/ci/gates.toml AND .github/workflows/pr-fast.yml.
Validates structural properties; never mutates the workflow file.

EXIT:
  0  pr-fast.yml is structurally consistent with the manifest.
  1  one or more drift conditions detected.
  2  parse error (YAML or TOML).
```

**Pivot from the original design** (recorded in §9 action log on
2026-05-06): the original §4.2 specified a YAML emitter that would
own the per-gate job blocks between marker comments.  Investigation
during Phase 3 prep showed that every job in `pr-fast.yml` is
bespoke — eleven distinct shapes for ~thirteen pr-fast-tier gates
(differences in runner OS, timeout, `needs:` chain, rust-cache key
strategy, free-disk preamble, conditional cargo-vet install + run,
multi-step commands, etc.).  Encoding all of that in TOML so the
generator can emit it back is a YAML-in-TOML translation problem
with no real upside, AND it stakes branch protection on a
hand-rolled YAML emitter.

The structural-validator design retains every drift-protection
guarantee the original codegen design promised, while reducing the
blast radius to "same as Phase 1's `gates-drift`" — the tool only
reads files; it cannot break the workflow.

**Properties enforced by `gen-workflow --check`**:

1. **Job presence** — every manifest gate with `tier="pr-fast"` has
   a job in `pr-fast.yml` whose key matches the gate id (or a
   per-tier `consumer_names` override).
2. **`if:` predicate alignment** — every such job's `if:`
   expression matches the gate's `gate_when` class:
   - `gate_when = "always"`           → no `if:` (or vacuously true)
   - `gate_when = "rust_changed"`     → `needs.classify.outputs.rust == 'true'`
   - `gate_when = "dep_changed"`      → `needs.classify.outputs.dep == 'true'`
   - `gate_when = "infra_changed"`    → `needs.classify.outputs.infra == 'true'`
   - `gate_when = "code_changed"`     → `needs.classify.outputs.code == 'true'`
3. **Aggregator coverage** — every gate's id is present in:
   - `required.needs:` list
   - the `declare -A R=(...)` aggregator inside the `required` job
   - `notify-failure.needs:` list
   This is the exact failure mode that motivated the plan: a rename
   in the manifest that wasn't propagated to all three list-shaped
   consumers in this single file.
4. **Branch-protection guard** — the `required` job's `name:` is
   exactly the literal string `PR Fast CI / required`.  This name
   is in the repo's branch-protection rule
   (`required_status_checks`); a generator that renamed it would
   silently break merge for every subsequent PR.
5. **Naming convention** — every per-gate job's `name:` field
   matches the manifest's `label` (or a documented mapping for
   legacy names).

**What is explicitly NOT validated** (and why):

- **Job step contents** — the actual `run:` commands, runner
  selection, cache key strategy, conditional steps.  These are
  per-job craft; pinning them via the validator would freeze
  legitimate evolution (e.g. adding a `df -h /` debug step
  during a disk-pressure investigation).  The Phase 1 `gates-drift`
  detector still catches the gate-set mismatch class; structural
  validator catches the "rename bookkeeping" class; per-step
  correctness stays in code review's hands.
- **YAML formatting** — indentation, blank-line placement, comment
  positioning.  These are reviewer concerns, not drift concerns.
- **Job ordering** — the file lists jobs in roughly cost order;
  the validator doesn't enforce any ordering invariant.

### 4.3 `scripts/ci/gen-docs` (Phase 3, deferred)

```
USAGE: gen-docs [--check]

Reads scripts/ci/gates.toml.
Writes (or checks) a gate-matrix table generated from the manifest.
```

**Status: deferred** (recorded in §9 action log on 2026-05-06).
Investigation during Phase 3 prep showed that every existing
gate-matrix table in the repo is prose-laden:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` §Four-layer quality gates: full-paragraph cells
  with W5/L1 migration history, runtime budgets, install hints.
- `docs/architecture/dev-flow.md` §3.2 Gate matrix: cells like
  `✅ if xwin (advisory; W5.6 upgraded from `check` to `clippy`)`.
- `docs/architecture/dev-flow-implementation-plan.md` §1.3.1 Hard
  gates: cells with rationale (`hard-fail with install hint — not
  soft-skip`, `pinned in .config/nextest.toml`).

None of this prose is derivable from the manifest's structured
fields without inventing per-table `notes_per_tier` /
`migration_history` / `missing_tool_behavior` fields.  At that
point we are encoding markdown prose in TOML, which is strictly
worse than markdown.

If gen-docs is ever revived, the right shape is **a new canonical
reference doc** (e.g. `docs/architecture/gates-manifest-reference.md`)
that is 100 % generated and is linked from the prose-heavy tables
as "see also".  The prose tables stay hand-maintained because
their value IS the prose.  Marginal value because the manifest
itself is already the canonical structured source; this would just
be a render.

### 4.4 Idempotency contract

- Running any generator without `--check` is **idempotent**: running
  it twice in a row produces no diff on the second run.
- Output is **deterministic**: byte-for-byte stable across:
  * macOS / Linux / Windows hosts (no host-dependent strings)
  * Different working directories (no absolute paths in output)
  * Different rust toolchain patches (within the pinned major)
- Generators consume `RUSTFLAGS` / `CARGO_*` env vars when emitting
  documentary expected-runtime values, so the comments don't drift
  with sccache cache state.

## 5. Phase-by-phase migration

### Phase 1 — Manifest + drift detector (`feat/gates-manifest-phase-1`)

**Scope**:

1. NEW `scripts/ci/gates.toml` — populated by reading the existing
   `_lint_fast.sh` + `_lint_pre_push.sh` + `pr-fast.yml` and
   transcribing every gate.  Hand-written for this PR; the generators
   come in Phase 2/3.
2. NEW `scripts/ci/check_gates_drift.sh` — small bash that:
   - Reads `gates.toml`
   - For each `[[gate]]` with the appropriate tier:
     * Greps the corresponding consumer file (`_lint_pre_push.sh` etc.)
       for the gate's `id` or `command`
     * Fails if a manifest entry is not present in the consumer
     * Fails if a consumer entry (matched against a known-form regex)
       is not present in the manifest
   - Pass = manifest and consumers agree on the gate set.
3. NEW pre-push hook step + NEW CI job (`gates-drift`) that runs the
   drift detector.  Both hard-fail on mismatch.
4. NEW NPM-style version field in `gates.toml` (`manifest.version = 1`).
   Bumping breaks downstream tools — surfaced in CI as a separate
   `manifest-version` job that requires a `version-bump` PR label.

**No existing-consumer changes.**  `_lint_fast.sh`, `_lint_pre_push.sh`,
and `pr-fast.yml` continue to be hand-maintained.  The manifest is
purely informational + a drift safety net.

**Acceptance criteria**:

- [ ] `scripts/ci/gates.toml` exists; passes `taplo check`.
- [ ] Manifest covers every gate currently defined in
      `_lint_fast.sh`, `_lint_pre_push.sh`, `pr-fast.yml`.
- [ ] `scripts/ci/check_gates_drift.sh` exits 0 against current `main`.
- [ ] Mutating the manifest (e.g. dropping a gate) → drift detector
      exits 1 with a clear "gate `foo` in manifest, missing from
      `_lint_pre_push.sh`" message.
- [ ] Mutating a hook (e.g. removing `lint-ci`) → drift detector
      exits 1 with a symmetric message.
- [ ] `pr-fast.yml` `gates-drift` job runs and gates the `required`
      aggregator (added to `needs:`).
- [ ] Pre-push hook runs the drift check as a Bucket-1 job
      (cheap, parallel, fire-and-forget — same tier as `fmt` /
      `file-size`).
- [ ] `actionlint` exit=0 on the modified `pr-fast.yml`.
- [ ] All existing CI checks still pass (no behavioural change).

**Risk**: Near-zero.  No consumer-file logic changes; only ADD a
manifest + a drift checker that fires loudly on mismatch.  Worst case:
drift detector has a false positive that blocks a PR — easy to disable
with the `manifest.version` bump escape hatch documented above, plus
a `BYPASS_GATES_DRIFT=1 git push` env-var bypass mirroring the
existing `COMMIT_SUBJECT_BYPASS=1` pattern in `_lint_pre_push.sh`.

**Verification before merge**:

```bash
# Drift detector behaves correctly
just gates-drift                                    # exit 0
sed -i.bak 's/lint-ci/lint-ci-removed/' scripts/ci/gates.toml
just gates-drift                                    # exit 1, helpful message
mv scripts/ci/gates.toml.bak scripts/ci/gates.toml  # restore

# Workflows still parse
actionlint .github/workflows/pr-fast.yml            # exit 0

# Hooks still work
just lint-pre-push                                  # exit 0, drift-check shows in output

# CI green on the PR (the gates-drift job is itself the new check)
```

**Verification after merge**:

- Watch the next 1-2 PRs that add or rename a gate (e.g. a
  Dependabot rust-toolchain bump that adds a new clippy lint).
  Drift detector should fire if any consumer was updated without the
  manifest, or vice versa.

### Phase 2 — Codegen for `_lint_pre_push.sh` (`feat/gates-manifest-phase-2`)

**Scope**:

1. NEW `scripts/ci/gen-hooks/` — Rust workspace member implementing
   `gen-hooks` per §4.1.  Single binary; no library exposure (the
   manifest model is internal to this binary).
2. NEW `tests/ci/golden/_lint_pre_push.sh` — byte-for-byte snapshot
   of the pre-Phase-2 hand-maintained file.  Updated only via
   explicit "golden update" PRs.
3. MODIFIED `scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh` — now generated.
   Header banner: `# AUTO-GENERATED by scripts/ci/gen-hooks; manual
   edits will be overwritten.  Source: scripts/ci/gates.toml.`
4. NEW `just gen-hooks` recipe (alias `just gen` if no other generator
   exists yet) — runs the generator non-`--check`.
5. NEW CI job `hooks-drift` — runs `gen-hooks --check`; fails if
   regen would change the file.
6. NEW pre-push step (Bucket-1) — same drift check.

**Pre-commit hook stays hand-written.**  Reason: pre-commit's logic
is small (3 clippy spawns + a few bash conditionals); generating it
is more code than the file it replaces.  Phase 3 picks it up if/when
we extract enough common machinery.

**Acceptance criteria**:

- [ ] `cargo build -p gen-hooks` succeeds.
- [ ] `cargo test -p gen-hooks` covers schema parsing + emit
      determinism (same input → same output across runs).
- [ ] Running `just gen-hooks` produces `_lint_pre_push.sh` that is
      **byte-for-byte equivalent** to the golden snapshot.
- [ ] `diff -u tests/ci/golden/_lint_pre_push.sh scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh`
      → empty.
- [ ] `bash -n scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh` (syntax check).
- [ ] `just lint-pre-push` exits 0 with **identical** observable
      behaviour to pre-PR (same gate list, same bucket assignment,
      same fail-fast order, same wall-clock within ±10%).
- [ ] Manually trigger a `git push` (e.g. push a no-op commit on a
      throwaway branch) → hook fires correctly.
- [ ] Phase-1 drift detector still passes.
- [ ] CI's new `hooks-drift` job runs and gates the `required`
      aggregator.

**Risk**: Medium.  Generator bugs could silently drop a gate, change
fail-fast order, or shuffle bucket assignments.  The byte-for-byte
golden-file diff is the primary safety net: any unintentional change
shows up as a diff in the PR; intentional changes require updating
the golden in the same commit (visible in review).

**Verification before merge**:

```bash
# Codegen + drift loop
just gen-hooks                                      # writes file
diff -u tests/ci/golden/_lint_pre_push.sh \
        scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh             # empty
just hooks-drift                                    # exit 0
just gates-drift                                    # exit 0 (Phase 1 still passes)

# Behavioural equivalence
just lint-pre-push                                  # exit 0, same gates
git push --dry-run origin HEAD:refs/heads/test     # hook runs, exit 0

# Mutation testing
echo '# garbage' >> scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh
just hooks-drift                                    # exit 1 (catches manual edit)
git checkout scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh       # revert
```

**Rollback**: Revert the PR.  `_lint_pre_push.sh` is byte-for-byte
identical to the pre-Phase-2 file (the golden), so reverting yields
the previous hand-maintained version exactly.

### Phase 3 — `pr-fast.yml` structural validator (`feat/gates-manifest-phase-3-workflow-drift`)

**Scope** (revised from the original "big-bang Phase 3" plan):

1. NEW `scripts/ci/gen-workflow/` — Rust binary per §4.2.
   `--check`-only.  Reads `scripts/ci/gates.toml` AND
   `.github/workflows/pr-fast.yml`; validates the five structural
   properties listed in §4.2; never mutates the workflow file.
2. NEW manifest `[[gate]]` entry `workflow-drift` — self-referential
   gate at tier `[pre-push, pr-fast]`, bucket `bg`,
   `gate_when = always`, `hard = true`.  The generator that emits
   `_lint_pre_push.sh` (Phase 2's `gen-hooks`) picks this up
   automatically; no Phase-2-side changes needed.
3. NEW `pr-fast.yml::workflow-drift` job — hand-written following
   the same shape as Phase 1's `gates-drift` and Phase 2's
   `hooks-drift`.  Validates the workflow against itself.
4. NEW `just workflow-drift` recipe.
5. MODIFIED `docs/architecture/gates-manifest-plan.md` — §4.2
   pivoted from "YAML emitter" to "structural validator".
6. MODIFIED `CHANGELOG.md` — entry under `[Unreleased]`.

**Explicitly NOT in scope**:

- **`_lint_fast.sh` codegen** (the original Phase 3a) — deferred /
  skipped.  Phase 1's `gates-drift` already catches the only
  meaningful failure mode (gate-set mismatch).  Generating the
  ~70-line file would cost more code than it saves; symmetry with
  `_lint_pre_push.sh` is not worth the complexity.  If revived,
  it's a tiny extension to Phase 2's `gen-hooks` (add an
  `EmitTarget::PreCommit` variant).
- **`gen-docs`** (the original Phase 3c) — deferred.  See §4.3.
- **YAML emission of any kind** — see §4.2 pivot rationale.

**Critical constraint preserved**: `pr-fast.yml`'s `required` job's
`name:` field is `PR Fast CI / required`.  The structural validator
actively enforces this string (Property 4 in §4.2) so future
refactors cannot silently break branch protection.

**Acceptance criteria**:

- [ ] `gen-workflow --check` exits 0 against the current
      `pr-fast.yml` (= Phase 2's tip-of-main version, including the
      `workflow-drift` job once added).
- [ ] Synthetic-mutation tests prove each of the five structural
      properties is enforced (rename a gate → detected; remove a
      gate from `required.needs:` → detected; flip an `if:`
      predicate to the wrong class → detected; rename the `required`
      job → detected; mismatch a job `name:` field → detected).
- [ ] All Phase 1 + Phase 2 acceptance items still hold.
- [ ] `actionlint .github/workflows/pr-fast.yml` exit=0 (sanity
      check; not validator-enforced).
- [ ] Drift detectors (`gates-drift`, `hooks-drift`,
      `workflow-drift`) all pass.
- [ ] No mutation of `pr-fast.yml` job step contents — only the
      additive `workflow-drift` job, which is itself byte-for-byte
      identical to the patterns established by `gates-drift` /
      `hooks-drift` (no novel YAML shape to validate).

**Risk**: Low.  `gen-workflow` only reads files; it cannot break
the workflow.  The `workflow-drift` job added to `pr-fast.yml` uses
the exact same shape as the existing `hooks-drift` job (5 lines of
YAML, no new pattern).  The branch-protection guard string
(`PR Fast CI / required`) is asserted by the validator itself, so
a future PR that renamed it would fail `workflow-drift` before
landing.

**Verification before merge**:

```bash
cargo test -p uffs-gen-workflow                      # unit tests
cargo run -q --release -p uffs-gen-workflow -- --check  # exit 0
bash scripts/ci/check_gates_drift.sh                  # exit 0 (Phase 1)
cargo run -q --release -p uffs-gen-hooks -- --check   # exit 0 (Phase 2)
just lint-pre-push                                    # exit 0 (full sweep)
actionlint .github/workflows/pr-fast.yml              # exit 0
```

**Rollback**: Revert the PR.  No file is mutated except the
additive `workflow-drift` job in `pr-fast.yml` and the additive
`[[gate]]` entry in the manifest — both safe to revert.

**Future evolution**: if YAML generation ever becomes desirable
(e.g. the workspace grows past ~30 pr-fast gates and the bespoke-
shape problem becomes a maintenance burden), the structural
validator established here is the foundation: a generator can be
added later that emits between markers, with the validator enforcing
property equivalence between hand-written and generated sections
during the transition.

## 6. Golden-file verification strategy

Each generated file gets a sibling under `tests/ci/golden/` with the
same basename.  The golden is committed alongside the generator
change that introduces it.  Updating a golden is a deliberate review
event:

- **Routine regen** (e.g. add a new gate to the manifest): the
  generator output changes → the golden must be updated in the same
  commit → reviewer sees the diff explicitly and ack's it.
- **Generator bug fix**: same flow.  Golden update is the visible
  evidence that the bug is fixed.
- **Schema bump** (`manifest.version`): may produce a wholesale
  golden rewrite.  Encouraged to land in a dedicated PR with the
  `manifest-version` label.

### CI step: `golden-diff`

```bash
# Run by every drift detector job
for f in tests/ci/golden/*; do
    target=$(basename "$f")
    case "$target" in
        _lint_pre_push.sh|_lint_fast.sh)
            actual="scripts/hooks/$target" ;;
        pr-fast.yml)
            actual=".github/workflows/$target" ;;
    esac
    if ! diff -u "$f" "$actual" >/dev/null; then
        echo "❌ $target diverges from golden:"
        diff -u "$f" "$actual"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

This is the load-bearing piece of the whole plan.  As long as the
golden diff is part of CI's `required` aggregator, no generator
regression can ship undetected.

## 7. Open questions

### 7.1 Generator language

**Decision**: Rust.

Considered: bash (too fragile for TOML parsing — would need `dasel`
or `taplo` as a hard runtime dep), Python (drags Python into the
build path), Rust (already on every contributor's machine).

Rust binaries are compiled once and cached by `Swatinem/rust-cache`
in CI; local generator runs are sub-second after first build.  Cost:
~15 s of cold compile per fresh checkout.

### 7.2 Manifest format

**Decision**: TOML.

Considered: YAML (footguns around quoting + bool coercion), JSON (no
comments, ugly diffs), TOML (existing project standard — `Cargo.toml`,
`deny.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `clippy.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`,
`REUSE.toml`).  The `taplo` formatter is already installed by
`just install-dev-tools` and runs at pre-commit so manifest
formatting drift is auto-caught.

### 7.3 Should `just` recipes be generated too?

**Decision**: No.

The lint recipes (`lint-prod`, `lint-tests`, `lint-ci`,
`lint-ci-windows`, `lint-ci-linux`, `lint-ci-linux-zig`) are
human-facing entry points whose ergonomics matter (printf colour
prefixes, clear error messages, helpful install hints).  Generating
them costs more readability than it saves.

The hooks call these recipes via `just lint-ci` etc., so the recipe
NAMES (which the generator references) are part of the manifest's
implicit contract.  A `recipe = "lint-ci"` field on each `[[gate]]`
documents the binding.

### 7.4 What about Tier 2 (`tier-2.yml`)?

**Out of scope.**

Tier 2 is the deep-assurance lane (coverage, miri, udeps); each job
is uniquely shaped (different toolchains, different timeouts,
different cache keys).  Forcing them into the gate-manifest schema
loses fidelity.  Tier 2 stays hand-maintained.

### 7.5 What about `release.yml` / `tier-2.yml` / `codeql.yml` / etc.?

**Out of scope.**

Those workflows have orthogonal concerns (release artifact signing,
weekly cron deep-checks, third-party SAST orchestration).  The
manifest's mandate is the **PR-time gate set** — what blocks merge.
Other workflows are opaque to it.

## 9. Action log

| Date | Event | PR |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-06 | Plan drafted (this doc) + landed | #139 |
| 2026-05-06 | Phase 1 landed — manifest + drift detector + pre-push Bucket 1 wiring + `pr-fast.yml::gates-drift` job + `just gates-drift` recipe | #140 |
| 2026-05-06 | Phase 2 landed — `scripts/ci/gen-hooks` Rust crate + auto-generated `_lint_pre_push.sh` + `hooks-drift` self-referential gate + `just gen-hooks` / `just hooks-drift` recipes + `pr-fast.yml::hooks-drift` job | #141 |
| 2026-05-06 | **Phase 3 plan pivot** — §4.2 revised from "YAML emitter with markers" to "structural validator (`--check` only)".  Investigation during Phase 3 prep showed every per-gate job in `pr-fast.yml` is bespoke (eleven distinct shapes for ~thirteen gates); encoding all of that in TOML degenerates to YAML-in-TOML.  Structural validator retains every drift-protection guarantee at the same risk profile as Phase 1's `gates-drift`.  §4.3 (gen-docs) and §Phase 3a (`_lint_fast.sh` codegen) deferred for the same reasons (prose tables, marginal value).  This PR lands the plan revision; implementation lands in a follow-up PR. | TBD |
| 2026-05-06 | Phase 3 plan-revision PR landed | #142 |
| 2026-05-06 | Phase 3 landed — `scripts/ci/gen-workflow` Rust crate (33 unit tests covering manifest schema, hand-rolled YAML extractor, four structural property checks with mutation tests) + hand-rolled YAML extractor (no `serde_yml` advisory exposure, zero new cargo-vet exemptions) + `workflow-drift` self-referential gate + `pr-fast.yml::workflow-drift` job + `just workflow-drift` / `just gen-workflow` recipes.  All three drift detectors (`gates-drift`, `hooks-drift`, `workflow-drift`) now run side-by-side in pre-push Bucket 1 + pr-fast CI, covering three orthogonal drift axes (gate-set / hook-content / workflow-structural). | #143 |
| 2026-05-07 | Phase 3a landed — `gen-hooks` extended with `--target {pre-push,pre-commit}` flag + `EmitTarget::PreCommit` variant + `render_dispatch_fast()` + four per-gate emit shapes (always-on, rust-staged-group, rust-or-no-staged, special-case taplo + vet-fmt).  Two new templates (`templates/preamble_fast.sh`, `templates/footer_fast.sh`) embedded via `include_str!`.  `_lint_fast.sh` regenerated from the manifest; the legacy hand-written dispatch comments are now in `gates.toml` `notes` (single source of truth).  10 new unit tests in `gen-hooks` (32 total, was 22) covering all six dispatch shapes + idempotency + the pre-push/pre-commit-render-distinct contract.  `fast-drift` self-referential gate added to manifest (order 28, next to `workflow-drift`'s 27); `pr-fast.yml::fast-drift` job wired (mirroring `hooks-drift` shape, cache shared with `sanity`); `just gen-fast` + `just fast-drift` recipes added.  All four drift detectors (`gates-drift`, `hooks-drift`, `workflow-drift`, `fast-drift`) now run side-by-side in pre-push Bucket 1 + pr-fast CI, covering four orthogonal drift axes (gate-set / pre-push-hook-content / workflow-structural / pre-commit-hook-content). | #144 |
