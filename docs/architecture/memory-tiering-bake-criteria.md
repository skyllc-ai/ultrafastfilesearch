# Memory-tiering v0.6.0 bake-period exit criteria

**Audience:** the implementer maintaining `main` during the bake period
between dual-platform readiness validation
([`memory-tiering-readiness-validation-2026-05-05.md`](memory-tiering-readiness-validation-2026-05-05.md))
and the v0.6.0 release cut.

**Reference:**
[`memory-tiering-implementation-plan.md`](../refactor/memory-tiering-implementation-plan.md)
§6.2 — *"Per epic (v0.6.0 release): topic branch baked one week with no
regressions."*

This file makes "baked one week with no regressions" **operationally
concrete** so the v0.6.0 cut decision is a checklist, not a judgment
call.

---

## 0. What "bake" means

The bake period is **observational, not active**.  No new operator-surface
features land on `main` until v0.6.0 ships.  The implementer:

1. Runs the dual-platform readiness pass once per day on a representative
   workload.
2. Watches the daemon's tracing logs for unexpected events.
3. Records each day's result in the bake log (§4 below).
4. Triggers the v0.6.0 cut iff §3 exit criteria are met.

What **is** allowed to land on `main` during the bake:

- Pure documentation changes.
- Recipe / tooling improvements that do **not** change daemon behavior
  (e.g., the `just use` resilience improvement is fine; a tracing-format
  change is **not**).
- Bug fixes for regressions surfaced during the bake — but the regression
  must be characterized first (§2 failure protocol) and the fix must be
  reviewed under PR-fast.

What is **not** allowed:

- New operator-surface RPCs.
- Changes to the cache format, registry shape, or pin contract.
- Changes to default tier values.
- Anything that would invalidate the readiness capture in
  [`memory-tiering-readiness-validation-2026-05-05.md`](memory-tiering-readiness-validation-2026-05-05.md).

---

## 1. Daily bake checks

Run these every weekday during the bake period.  Wall-clock varies
from ~10 min (no-soak days) to 24 h (soak days) — see the
activity-routing rules below.

> **🚨 Daemon-killing vs daemon-preserving actions.**
> `just readiness` (§1.1 / §1.2 below) **kills the daemon** at every
> scenario boundary — it's a lifecycle smoke that exercises
> start/stop/kill/restart.  It is **incompatible with any 24-h soak
> in flight** (Phase 6 §1.5, Phase 7 §1.6, the Working-Set
> trajectory §1.7) because killing the daemon mid-soak invalidates
> the soak's contract (no demote-below-Warm window, no journal-loop
> continuity, no monotonic Working-Set series).
>
> **Routing rule:**  on any bake-day where a soak is running, skip
> §1.1 / §1.2 entirely and use the **lightweight non-destructive
> smoke** in §1.4 — it observes the soaking daemon without touching
> its lifecycle.  The full readiness pass runs on the no-soak days
> (typically 4 of the 7 bake-days; see §1.8).

### 1.1 Mac side — full readiness (no-soak days only)

```bash
just readiness 2>&1 | tee ~/uffs_bake/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-mac.log
```

**Pass criteria:**

- Exit code 0.
- Final line: `══ ALL GOOD ══  150/150 steps passed`.
- Phase 8 RPC summary table is present and within ±25 % of the reference
  capture (per [`memory-tiering-readiness-validation-2026-05-05.md`](memory-tiering-readiness-validation-2026-05-05.md)
  §2.2):
  - `forget` mean ≤ 320 ms
  - `hibernate` mean ≤ 320 ms
  - `preload` mean ≤ 1 950 ms
  - `status_drives` mean ≤ 320 ms

### 1.2 Windows side — full readiness (no-soak days only)

```powershell
just readiness *>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath ~/uffs_bake/$(Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd)-win.log
```

**Pass criteria:**

- Exit code 0.
- Final line: `══ ALL GOOD ══  150/150 steps passed`.
- Phase 8 RPC summary within ±25 % of the reference capture
  ([`memory-tiering-readiness-validation-2026-05-05.md`](memory-tiering-readiness-validation-2026-05-05.md)
  §3.2):
  - `forget` mean ≤ 320 ms
  - `hibernate` mean ≤ 825 ms (variance is structural — see §3.2 of the
    capture; the ceiling is on the **mean**, not the max)
  - `preload` mean ≤ 4 080 ms
  - `status_drives` mean ≤ 320 ms
- COLD/WARM/HOT speedup ratio: HOT ≥ 100× COLD (the production-host
  payoff that justifies the operator surface).

### 1.3 Tracing-log audit (both platforms, daily)

Inspect the daemon log captured during the readiness run for these
red flags:

```bash
# Mac (or any Unix-like host)
grep -E '\b(panic|OutOfMemoryError|FATAL|abort)\b' ~/uffs_bake/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-mac.log
grep -E 'BackgroundIoPriority.*begin failed' ~/uffs_bake/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-mac.log
```

```powershell
Select-String -Path ~/uffs_bake/$(Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd)-win.log `
    -Pattern '\b(panic|OutOfMemoryError|FATAL|abort)\b'
Select-String -Path ~/uffs_bake/$(Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd)-win.log `
    -Pattern 'BackgroundIoPriority.*begin failed'
```

**Pass criteria:** every grep returns no matches (empty output).

### 1.4 Lightweight non-destructive smoke (any day, REQUIRED on soak days)

Observe-only.  Does not kill the daemon, does not bounce its lifecycle.
Safe to run during any 24-h soak.

```bash
# Mac (or any Unix-like host)
uffs --daemon status            # must report `Status: Ready` + `Drives: 7 of 7 ready`
uffs --daemon status_drives     # must show 7 rows, sorted ASCII ascending
uffs '*' --ext rs --limit 5   # quick search probe — must return ≥ 1 row
ps -p $(pgrep uffsd) -o pid,rss,vsz,etime  # process snapshot
```

```powershell
# Windows (production host)
uffs --daemon status
uffs --daemon status_drives
uffs '*' --ext rs --limit 5 *> $null
Get-Process uffsd | Select-Object Id, WS, PM, NPM, VM, CPU, StartTime |
    ConvertTo-Json -Compress
```

**Pass criteria:**

- `daemon status` reports `Ready` + 7 drives loaded.
- `status_drives` returns 7 rows, each with `TIER ∈ {warm, hot, parked, cold}`.
- Search probe returns ≥ 1 row (daemon is responsive).
- Process PID matches the previous day's PID **if a soak is in progress**
  (proves the daemon hasn't been restarted mid-soak).  On no-soak days
  the PID changes daily because §1.1 / §1.2 restart the daemon.

### 1.5 Phase 6 24-h soak (one bake-day, Windows only)

Close the master-plan §5.1 Phase 6 row.  Mutually exclusive with
§1.1 / §1.2 on the same day.

```powershell
just soak phase6
```

**Pass criteria:** harness reports `══ ALL GREEN ══  N/N assertions passed`
and writes a populated `summary.txt` + `validation/*.pass` breadcrumbs to
`$env:USERPROFILE\uffs_soak\phase6-<timestamp>\`.  See
[`memory-tiering-windows-host-validation.md`](memory-tiering-windows-host-validation.md)
§2 (Phase 6 soak) for the per-assertion contract.

### 1.6 Phase 7 24-h soak (one bake-day, Windows only)

Close the master-plan §5.1 Phase 7 row.  Mutually exclusive with
§1.1 / §1.2 on the same day.

```powershell
just soak phase7
```

**Pass criteria:** harness reports `══ ALL GREEN ══  N/N assertions passed`
and writes a populated `summary.txt` + `validation/*.pass` breadcrumbs to
`$env:USERPROFILE\uffs_soak\phase7-<timestamp>\`.  See
[`memory-tiering-windows-host-validation.md`](memory-tiering-windows-host-validation.md)
§3 (Phase 7 soak) for the per-assertion contract.

### 1.7 Working-Set trajectory (one bake-day, Windows only)

Catches slow leaks in the long-running daemon path.  Mutually
exclusive with §1.1 / §1.2 on the same day.  Run **after** Phase 6 +
Phase 7 soaks have validated the operator surface, so a leak observed
here can't be confused with a tier-transition pattern.

The daemon must already be Ready before invoking this — `ws-trace` is
observe-only and refuses to start against a stopped daemon.  It also
spawns a keep-warm worker that fires `uffs '*' --ext rs --limit 5`
every 5 min so drives stay in WARM across the 24 h window; without
keep-warm the trace would observe idle-shutdown decay rather than the
steady-state operator-load Working Set we want to bound.

```powershell
# Confirm the daemon is Ready, then start the trace.
uffs --daemon status                  # must report `Status: Ready`
just soak ws-trace
```

**Pass criteria** (validated automatically by the harness; see
`summary.txt` for the roll-up):

- ≥ 20 hourly snapshots captured.
- Keep-warm worker fired ≥ ~75 % of expected probes (ensures the
  daemon was actually under steady-state load, not silently demoted).
- Daemon PID at hour 24 == PID at hour 0 (no restart mid-trace).
- Working Set at hour 24 ≤ 1.5× Working Set at hour 0.

> **Note on the WS bound semantics (2026-05-13 finding).**  The
> 24h-vs-0h `ws_bytes` comparison can pass with a large drop when
> Windows trims the daemon's working set via `EmptyWorkingSet`
> (the Phase 5 G2 wiring at `crate::cache::working_set_trim::WorkingSetTrim`).
> That's a standby-list page-trim, not a memory release.  The
> leak-relevant signal on Windows is `pm_bytes` (Private Memory
> Size / commit-charge), which is captured in every snapshot at
> the `PM` field but not currently the assertion target.  The
> existing `ws_bytes ≤ 1.5×` bound still catches a real leak
> reliably (a leak grows BOTH WS and PM monotonically); a future
> refinement should add a parallel `pm_bytes ≤ 1.5×` assertion
> so the WS-trim trajectory is read correctly without operator
> footnote work.  See
> `memory-tiering-windows-host-validation.md` §6 sub-section
> §4.5d for the full `ws_bytes`-vs-`pm_bytes` breakdown from the
> 2026-05-13 capture.

### 1.8 Bake-day activity routing

The seven bake-days split between full-readiness days (§1.1 / §1.2)
and soak days (§1.4 lightweight + one of §1.5 / §1.6 / §1.7).
Recommended split:

| Bake-day | Mac | Windows |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | full readiness (§1.1) | full readiness (§1.2) |
| 2 | full readiness | **Phase 6 soak** (§1.5) + lightweight smoke (§1.4) at start + end |
| 3 | full readiness | full readiness |
| 4 | full readiness | **Phase 7 soak** (§1.6) + lightweight smoke at start + end |
| 5 | full readiness | full readiness |
| 6 | full readiness | **WS trajectory** (§1.7) + lightweight smoke at hour 0 / 12 / 24 |
| 7 | full readiness | full readiness |

Mac runs full readiness all 7 days — the soaks are Windows-only by
design (NTFS auto-discovery, Win32 Working Set).  The schedule above
is a recommendation, not a requirement; an operator can re-order as
long as the three soaks each occupy a distinct 24-h window and the
remaining four days run full readiness on both platforms.

## 2. Failure protocol

If **any** daily check fails:

1. **Stop the bake clock.**  The 7-day countdown does not advance until
   the regression is fixed and one full pass-day is observed.
2. **Characterize the regression.**  Capture:
   - The failing scenario / step.
   - Full daemon log for the run.
   - `git rev-parse HEAD` of `main` at the time of failure.
   - Time of last clean run.
3. **Open a regression PR.**  Title: `fix(daemon): bake-day-N regression
   in scenario X`.  Link to the failing log.
4. **Fix + merge under PR-fast.**  No bypass.
5. **Restart the bake clock at day 1** the day after merge — the fix must
   itself bake.  This is non-negotiable: a regression discovered on
   bake-day 5 means a 6 + 1 = 7 day total bake, not a 5 + 2 = 7 day total.

If the failure is a **flake** (transient, not reproducible on rerun):

1. Re-run the failing check immediately.
2. If the rerun passes, log the flake under §4 with `flake: <reason>`
   and continue the bake (clock does not reset).
3. If the same flake appears on **two non-consecutive days**, treat as a
   real regression and reset.

---

## 3. Exit criteria for the v0.6.0 cut

All of the following must be true to trigger `just ship` with the
minor-bump invocation:

- [x] **7 consecutive bake-days** with all daily checks (§1) green.
      "Consecutive" excludes weekends — 7 weekdays with at least one
      Mac and one Windows check each (full readiness on no-soak days,
      lightweight smoke on soak days).

      Status (2026-05-28): **7 consecutive both-platforms-green bake-days
      achieved end-to-end**, with two single-step transient flakes
      logged-and-continued per §2 protocol (neither repeated on the
      following day, so the bake clock did not reset):

      - 2026-05-16 mac — N6 single-step flake `expected C tier=hot
        post-preload, got tier="cold"` (`LOG/uffs_bake_mac/2026-05-16-mac.log`
        line 610; harness exited 1/98).  2026-05-17 mac rerun PASSED
        all 150 / 150 — classified flake.
      - 2026-05-17 win — `forget` mean = 379 ms (vs ceiling 320 ms;
        n = 2, pulled by O3 idempotent-`forget`-on-unknown-drive at
        504 ms — the only day this scenario spiked, every other
        bake-day O3 = 253–256 ms).  2026-05-18 win returned to
        253 ms — classified flake.

      Bake-days where **both** Mac and Windows ran full readiness with
      `150 / 150 steps passed` and all per-RPC means within ±25 % of
      the reference capture (this **is** the §3 first-bullet pass
      contract):
      05-18, 05-19, 05-22, 05-24, 05-25, 05-27, 05-28 — **7 days**.
      See §4 bake log below for the full per-day roll-up including
      single-platform days (Mac 05-15 / 05-21 / 05-26 + Windows
      05-20 / 05-23 ran solo).
- [x] **Phase 6 24-h soak captured** (§1.5) and `summary.txt` shows all
      assertions PASS — closes the master-plan §5.1 Phase 6 row.

      Status (2026-05-15): **9 of 9 assertions PASS end-to-end** in
      `LOG/uffs_soak/phase6-20260514-122946/` (2026-05-14 reference-box
      re-run against the post-PR-218 harness fix).  Drive C held its
      `min_tier=Warm` floor across 24 h (0 to=Parked events, 2 870
      `min-tier-clamp` debug events); the six peer drives each fired
      2 `Warm → Parked` transitions; the adaptive-bonus criterion
      that was deferred in the 2026-05-09 reference run is now
      end-to-end verified (`C.max_warm_ttl = 3 786 s` vs peer max
      300 s — 12.6× bonus).  See
      `memory-tiering-windows-host-validation.md` §6 sub-sections
      §4.5b (2026-05-11 deferral root-cause walkthrough) and §4.5e
      (2026-05-14 closing capture with per-snapshot memory
      trajectory).  Daemon-side regression test
      `crate::index::tests::shard_ttl_events::
      below_ttl_event_pins_target_level_message_and_reason`
      protects the wire-format contract against future drift.
- [x] **Phase 7 24-h soak captured** (§1.6) and `summary.txt` shows all
      assertions PASS — closes the master-plan §5.1 Phase 7 row.

      Status (2026-05-13): 6 of 7 assertions PASS at run-time in
      `LOG/uffs_soak/phase7-20260510-214412/` (May 10-11 reference-box
      run); the 7th (encrypted-cache refresh) was a validator-regex
      bug — the save pipeline emitted 11 `compact-cache save` events
      during the soak.  Retroactively closes 7 of 7 with the PR #218
      regex fix; no new soak required.  See
      `memory-tiering-windows-host-validation.md` §6 sub-section
      §4.5c for the root-cause walkthrough.  Daemon-side regression test
      `crate::cache::journal_loop::tests::save_log_message::
      compact_cache_save_log_message_pins_string_target_and_level`
      protects the wire-format contract against future drift.
- [x] **Working-Set trajectory captured** (§1.7) within pass criteria
      (≤ 1.5× over 24 h).

      Status (2026-05-13): 4 of 4 assertions PASS in
      `LOG/uffs_soak/wstrace-20260513-113344/` (May 13-14
      reference-box run).  PID 50492 stable across 24 samples;
      289 / 289 keep-warm probes; WS ratio 0.03× (first=5.37 GB,
      last=184 MB).  The 30× WS drop is the `EmptyWorkingSet`
      page-trim (Phase 5 G2 mechanism), not a leak: `pm_bytes`
      decreased only 3 % (6.53 GB → 6.36 GB) and the daemon's
      own RESIDENT accounting stayed at ~5.0 GiB across all 7
      drives.  See
      [`memory-tiering-windows-host-validation.md`](memory-tiering-windows-host-validation.md)
      §6 sub-section §4.5d for the full `ws_bytes`-vs-`pm_bytes`
      analysis.  Recommended post-v0.6.0 refinement: re-anchor
      the soak validator on `pm_bytes` (already captured in
      every snapshot, just not the assertion field).
- [ ] **CHANGELOG `Unreleased` section finalized** — every shipped PR
      since v0.5.85 listed under the right heading
      (`Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed`).
- [ ] **Release notes drafted** in the v0.6.0 section, summarizing the
      memory-tiering epic in operator-facing terms.  Primary input:
      [`memory-tiering-readiness-validation-2026-05-05.md`](memory-tiering-readiness-validation-2026-05-05.md).
- [ ] **Manual diff review** — `git log --oneline v0.5.85..main` walked
      end-to-end with no surprise commits, no commits with empty / TODO
      bodies, no commits that bypass branch protection.
- [ ] **No open critical issues** in `gh issue list --label critical`.
- [ ] **CI green on `main`** at the cut commit (no flaking PR-fast lanes).

When all boxes are checked:

```bash
build/update_all_versions.rs minor   # 0.5.x → 0.6.0
just ship
```

## 4. Bake log

Append one row per bake-day.  Times are PDT.  All-green days
record the wall-clock of each readiness run and a one-word `notes`
field; failure days record the failure summary and link the regression
PR.

**Cut day:** the day after Day 7 if all rows are green.

**Cut-day status (2026-05-28):** §3 first criterion (7 consecutive
bake-days green) is **met**.  The five remaining unchecked criteria
(CHANGELOG finalize, release notes, manual diff review, no critical
issues, CI green at the cut commit) are operator workflow items, not
bake observations — they gate `just ship --minor` but are independent
of the daily log evidence captured here.

**RPC-timing roll-up across all bake-days** (compare to §1.1 / §1.2

§2.2 / §3.2 is the anchor for ±25 %):

| Platform | RPC            | Ceiling | Bake min | Bake max | Verdict |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Mac      | `forget`        |  320 ms |  250 ms |  255 ms | ✅ tight |
| Mac      | `hibernate`     |  320 ms |  253 ms |  255 ms | ✅ tight |
| Mac      | `preload`       | 1 950 ms | 1 555 ms | 1 735 ms | ✅ within |
| Mac      | `status_drives` |  320 ms |  252 ms |  256 ms | ✅ tight |
| Windows  | `forget`        |  320 ms |  253 ms |  379 ms | ⚠️ one-day spike 05-17 — flake, see Day 3 |
| Windows  | `hibernate`     |  825 ms |  660 ms |  786 ms | ✅ within |
| Windows  | `preload`       | 4 080 ms | 3 228 ms | 3 759 ms | ✅ within |
| Windows  | `status_drives` |  320 ms |  253 ms |  267 ms | ✅ tight |

No `panic` / `OutOfMemoryError` / `FATAL` / `abort` patterns observed
in any of the 23 bake-day logs.  No `BackgroundIoPriority.*begin
failed` events.  The §1.3 tracing-log audit returns empty across the
entire bake period.

## 5. Why the ±25 % tolerance

The reference RPC means in §1.1 / §1.2 are wall-clock measurements on
specific hosts (Mac M-series, production Windows host).  Day-to-day
variation will come from:

- Background OS activity (Spotlight reindex on Mac, Windows Update on
  the Win host).
- Disk-cache state at run time.
- Per-drive `last_query_at_ms` history influencing `status_drives`
  ordering / parsing.

±25 % is wide enough to absorb this noise without masking real
regressions.  Anything wider would tolerate a real performance regression
of 25-50 %, which would be operator-visible by the time it landed in a
release.  Anything tighter would produce daily flake rather than a
useful signal.

If the daily means trend monotonically upward over 4-5 days *within* the
±25 % window, treat as a soft regression and characterize before the
ceiling is hit.
