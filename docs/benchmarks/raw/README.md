# Raw benchmark captures

**Every number in every UFFS benchmark report is backed by one of these files.** The files are verbatim copies of the PowerShell capture logs from the test machine at the moment the canonical report was written. They are **never edited** after commit — if a follow-up run produces different numbers, those numbers go into a *new* file in this directory, not an edit of an existing one.

The full local forensic log directory (`LOG/` in the repo) is intentionally gitignored and contains many more captures than what lives here. This `raw/` directory is the curated, publication-quality subset that every claim in [`docs/benchmarks/`](../) cites.

## What's a "raw capture"?

These are exactly what PowerShell recorded during benchmark runs — banner lines, working-directory prefix, occasional typing corrections, all of it. They are not cleaned, summarised, or re-rendered. If a run had a startup glitch or a warm-up anomaly, it shows in the log and the corresponding benchmark table in the canonical report calls it out.

This is deliberate. "Post-processed marketing-friendly output" is exactly the failure mode the benchmark hub is promising *not* to ship. The tables in the published reports are derivative artefacts; these files are the primary sources. If a number in a published table disagrees with what these files show, the files win.

---

## How to reproduce

Elevated PowerShell from repo root, after `cargo build --release`:

```powershell
# cross-tool-vs-everything.txt was produced by:
rust-script .\scripts\windows\cross-tool-benchmark.rs `
    --rounds 30 --tools uffs_rust,es --sinks file `
    --drives C,D

# cold-parity-per-drive.txt was produced by:
.\scripts\windows\cold-parity-per-drive.ps1 `
    -Drives C,D,E,F,M,S -PurgeCacheFirst `
    -OutputFile LOG\my_parity_run.txt

# full-benchmark-suite.txt is the full benchmark battery including:
# - scale-sweep: drive-accumulation via repeated --drive-set invocations
# - targeted-queries: 30-round latency across all 7 drives per pattern
# See the top of the file for the exact PowerShell block used.
```

Per-user results will vary with CPU, drive topology (NVMe vs HDD ratio), filesystem fullness, and Windows Defender configuration. The comparisons *between* tools on any given machine tend to be stable; the absolute numbers drift by hardware.

## No-edit policy

These files are append-only at the directory level (new files can be added) and read-only at the file level (existing files are never modified after commit). If UFFS v0.5.70 produces faster numbers, those numbers land in a new `2026-XX-v0.5.70_*.txt` file alongside these. The v0.5.66 files stay exactly as they are.

This is the same policy as [`docs/benchmarks/archive/`](../archive/): primary sources live forever, no retroactive edits, comparison across eras is traceable because both eras are preserved intact.
