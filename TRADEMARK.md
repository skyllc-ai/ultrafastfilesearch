# UFFS Trademark Policy

The **UFFS** abbreviation, the full name **UltraFastFileSearch**, and the
UFFS logo (the rust-orange lightning bolt inside a magnifier on a dark
tile) are project trademarks owned by [Sky, LLC](https://github.com/skyllc-ai).
This document explains how you may and may not use them.

**Last updated:** April 2026
**Status:** common-law / unregistered mark. This policy applies the same
way a registered ® mark would, but enforcement is lighter.

---

## Why this file exists

The UFFS **source code** is licensed under the
[Mozilla Public License 2.0](LICENSE). That gives everyone the right to
use, modify, and redistribute the code.

The UFFS **name and logo** are separate. They identify *this* project —
the one at <https://github.com/skyllc-ai/UltraFastFileSearch> — and
distinguish it from forks, reimplementations, and unrelated software
that might look or sound similar. Copyright and trademark are two
different legal regimes; MPL-2.0 grants the first and says nothing about
the second.

This separation is standard practice. Mozilla does it for Firefox. The
Python Software Foundation does it for Python. The Rust Foundation does
it for Rust. Kubernetes, Linux, PostgreSQL, and every other major
open-source project have a trademark policy sitting alongside the code
license.

## What you can do without asking

You **can** do all of the following — no permission needed, no
attribution beyond normal editorial conventions:

- **Talk about UFFS.** Write blog posts, tutorials, reviews, comparisons,
  academic papers, Stack Overflow answers, or YouTube videos about it.
- **Link to the project.** Use the name and the logo in a hyperlink
  pointing to the official repository.
- **Use the name in book or article titles** when the book is genuinely
  about UFFS (e.g. "Getting Started with UFFS").
- **Say your software "uses UFFS," "integrates with UFFS," or "is
  compatible with UFFS"** — as long as that's true.
- **Use the logo at its intended size and proportions** in slides, posts,
  articles, or videos that are *about* UFFS. Don't redraw it, don't
  recolor it, don't mash it up with your own logo.
- **Ship unmodified redistributions** of the upstream project (e.g. a
  Linux distribution package of the exact upstream source) using the
  UFFS name and logo.

These uses fall under what trademark law calls **nominative fair use**:
you're referring to the real thing, by its real name, and no reasonable
person would be confused about the source.

## What you cannot do without asking

You **may not**, without prior written permission:

- **Call your own software "UFFS," "UltraFastFileSearch," or any
  confusingly similar name.** A modified fork that you distribute needs
  a different name. (Want to call your fork "UFFS Turbo"? Ask first.)
- **Sell merchandise, stickers, T-shirts, mugs, pins, or any physical
  goods carrying the UFFS name or logo.** Even at cost, even for
  community events — ask first.
- **Use the UFFS logo as part of your own company or product logo**,
  even if your product is related to or built on UFFS.
- **Register a domain name, trademark, social media handle, app store
  listing, or company name that contains "UFFS" or
  "UltraFastFileSearch."**
- **Claim or imply endorsement, partnership, or sponsorship** by UFFS,
  Sky, LLC, or the project maintainers.
- **Modify the logo or wordmark.** No recoloring, no redrawing, no
  adding your own badge on top. If you need a variant that doesn't
  exist in the brand kit, open an issue tagged `brand`.
- **Use the logo in a way that would harm the project's reputation**,
  such as on malware, misleading marketing, or content unrelated to the
  tool.

## Forks

Forks are welcome — that's the whole point of open source. If you fork
UFFS and want to distribute your fork publicly, here's the rule:

1. **If you're shipping the upstream code with only mechanical changes**
   (e.g. a Debian package, a Homebrew formula, a Nix derivation), you
   can keep the UFFS name and logo. That's nominative use.

2. **If you're maintaining a long-lived fork with meaningful divergence**
   (your own features, your own bug fixes, your own release cadence),
   **rename it.** Pick something distinctive. Keep the UFFS name *only*
   in factual references: "Fork of UFFS," "Based on UFFS," "Compatible
   with UFFS." You cannot ship it *as* UFFS.

This protects both you and the project. Your fork gets to build its own
identity without being confused with upstream, and upstream doesn't end
up on the hook for bugs you introduced.

Same rule applies to reimplementations: if you rewrite UFFS in Go,
that's cool — call it something else.

## Getting permission

For anything in the "ask first" list: open a GitHub issue on the
repository with the label `brand`, or email
[`trademark@uffs.io`](mailto:trademark@uffs.io).

Tell us:

- Who you are.
- What you want to do.
- Where the work will appear (URL, product, event, etc.).
- How much UFFS branding will be visible and how long you expect to use
  it.

We will respond within a reasonable time. Permission, when granted, is
non-exclusive, revocable, and specific to the use you described.

---

## Enforcement

We don't aggressively chase every edge case. We will ask you — politely
— to stop if:

- Users are being confused about the source of your software.
- Your fork is shipping security issues under the UFFS name.
- You're monetizing the mark without permission.
- Your use meaningfully harms the project's reputation.

Most disputes end at "please change the name of your fork" and everyone
moves on. If they don't, Sky, LLC reserves the right to pursue
common-law trademark claims.

## Changes to this policy

This policy may be updated as the project matures (including,
eventually, formal trademark registration). Check the commit history of
this file for past revisions. The current version is always the one at
the repository's `HEAD`.

*This policy draws on the structure of the
[Rust Foundation trademark policy](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/logo-policy-and-media-guide/)
and the [CNCF / Kubernetes trademark policy](https://www.cncf.io/about/trademark-usage/),
adapted for a smaller, unregistered mark.*
